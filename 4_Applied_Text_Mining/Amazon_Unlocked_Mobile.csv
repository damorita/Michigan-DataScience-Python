Apple iPhone 5s 32GB (Space Gray) - T-Mobile,Apple,192,1,Serious problems with the phone. Isnt compatible with tmobile but says in the factory settings that the carrier is tmobile. Also isn't unlocked like they claim to be. Don't buy the phone it's just a huge hassle,6

Apple iPhone 5s 32GB (Space Gray) - T-Mobile,Apple,192,5,Got the phone worked perfectly with my carrier no issues what so ever. Good buy.,1
Apple iPhone 5s 32GB (Space Gray) - T-Mobile,Apple,192,1,"This phone was bought as a birthday gift.(I didnt open the package to inspect because I assumed it was new and nothing to worry about. It was sealed in plastic) The first thing the birthday girl noticed was the dust under the screen, stickers everywhere and the knock off charger. She over looked it because the phone worked. Two days later the phone stopped working and she asked if the phone was used. After taking the phone into tmobile together, they confirmed the phone was used and the imei # is blocked from their network (that means either stolen/owing money/fraud). In other words they cant help me and I should return it. Went home to pack the phone back in the box and arrange to return it then I noticed the stickers I mentioned earlier were actually meant to hide info on the box. Long story short, the box is not for this phone. The imei on the sticker is different to the one on the box. So this seller got an old box, printed stickers to match the imei/specs of the phone and placed it over the info on the box. Do not buy from this person. If you do make sure to ask for that IMEI first. Here's some pictures just in case they plan to re-sell the same phone without being honest. I blacked out the end of the imei for security reasons but it's clear the both numbers don't match. Worst purchase ever!!!!!",48

Apple iPhone 5s 32GB (Space Gray) - T-Mobile,Apple,192,1,"Buyer beware. These refurbished phones are stolen and being resold as refurbished. I bought my iPhone 5s refurbished in April 2015. Works okay out of the box. Yesterday, it stopped charging so I had the battery replaced by a phone repair store. It worked fine again, until the next morning where it was frozen (blank screen and wouldn't reboot). I brought it to the Apple Store and they told me it's a stolen iPhone. Apparently, the original serial no. of the phone gets reported to Apple when someone repairs it and Apple can freeze the iPhone if its stolen.",3

Apple iPhone 5s 32GB (Space Gray) - T-Mobile,Apple,192,5,"Definitely worth the extra dollars when compared to the 5, and the 5c. The fingerprint unlock system is clever and effective.

Apple iPhone 5s 32GB (Space Gray) - T-Mobile,Apple,192,5,"I was suspicous at first but decided to take my chance. The phone arrived in brand new condition and with all the accessories. Everything was sealed with plastic protector. Considering the price, this is a amazing deal. You can probably get one from eBay for about $400 but that usually does not include accessories and the phone itself is in ""New (other)"" condition, whatever that means.Activation took about 3 minutes in the t-mobile store.The phone does not come with a t-mobile logo though. I am not sure if it actually was made for some other carriers, or even overseas. But so far so good, I will update this in a month if anybody is interested.OK, it's been almost a month. Everything still good. My daughter loves the games on it. And my wife is satisfied with the battery life. Just for curiosity, I checked the ESN at Apple website and gladly found it is under warranty until next July. I guess I just got good luck.",2

The gold color on the back is very light, more like a champagne color, but it's a very unique and unseen color for any phone, which makes, whoever buys it, stand out and unique. it's an iPhone, so that only means that it's synonymous with greatness! I love the new, fresh OS that came preloaded on the device, and the hardware is excellent too, especially the newly-debuted fingerprint reader. This phone is just downright simplistic and user-friendly that even your nana or grandpa can use it.",14

Buying refurbished it was easy to afford 64 GB, able to hold and manage my large music and photo/video libraries. As soon as I started it up it began synchronizing with my two Apple laptops, and now is continuously updated, and all devices are able to use the Apple system transparently, including iCloud iTunes and the many good supported apps. I bought the 5s because it's the right size for me. It fits easily in any pocket. The pictures are good enough that I almost never use my digital cameras.

Apple iPhone 5s 32GB (Space Gray) - T-Mobile,Apple,192,5,"Upgraded from from a 4s that met an unscheduled demise. Was pretty burned about it until my 5s showed up in the mail. If you keep your phone locked, the fingerprint ID alone is worth the upgrade. One touch and you're in! Punching in a code every time you want to access your phone seems so archaic. All the other features are just icing on top. I'm one of those who is just not into this current fad of gargantuan cell phones just to have a big screen. I loved the size of the 4, and after having the 5 for awhile I think it's the perfect size. Still easy to ""one-hand"" the phone and still easily slips into your front jeans pocket.

Apple iPhone 5s 32GB (Space Gray) - T-Mobile,Apple,192,2,"First let me identify the seller ""Phone-Zone"". So many people complain about a seller, but they don't give the name.First the phone (IPhone 5s) took longer than normal to get here, but the weathers been bad, so ok. The real problem was that while everything stated by the seller and Amazon on the website, receipt and labeling, implied that the phone was new and T-Mobile ready, is now in doubt. I was unable to activate the phone with my carrier T-Mobile because the SIM was unusable or not installed. After some trouble I was able to get the SIM cover off, and there was a T-Mobile SIM installed. So the SIM is either defective or had been activated before. So no phone.I am driving the 30 miles to my local T-Mobile store tomorrow, to try and get the phone working, and to find out its history. I'm hoping they're good with IPhones, because while working over the phone with T-Mobile to resolve the problem, the SIM card became jammed in the IPhone (poor design). SO NO PHONE!When you spend the kind of money Apple asks for their products, you expect more. I've owned three Apple products, including this one, and had problems with two of the three. That's Not Good.Overall, I give the 5s just 2 stars and the seller Phone-Zone 0 stars.",5

It had a few light nicks and scratches, nothing I was really worried about, but the camera totally sucked. No matter what trick I tried (I've read all the message boards), the camera on this phone simply will not focus. Overall, I don't recommend purchasing this item. Just go to an Apple store and get the iPhone S. Yes, it will cost you about $150 more, but it's well worth the extra money. I ended up doing that after having this phone for only 2 months. The camera feature is too important to me. Plus, if you purchase a new phone, you'll have the warranty and protection. Buying this particular phone from this particular company is very risky.",0

Apple iPhone 5s 32GB (Space Gray) - T-Mobile,Apple,192,5,"This phone was a major transition from android based phones. After 2 weeks of really getting accustomed to this Apple iPhone it really changed the perspective I have of apple. First, it is pricey but worth the investment because of its smoothness, quality, and warm feeling of ownership it gives you. Second, battery life was an substantial improvement over many android phones I have owned that do not have a problem draining on your time. Siri is awesome and a person that does not use vocal command devices will have a great time with issuing out commands and asking questions.My only cons are I wish that many android based apps were transferrable but no complaints because the way technology is common to adaptation and delivering the very best to its consumers it'll only be a matter of time.The screen display is excellent but unfortunately this phone isn't as big either compared to other ultra smartphones but definitely makes up with its sleek traditionalistic screen and clarity. I think if you can afford this product and need a device that can be used wonderfully in a personal or professional setting then this is where it's at.",0

You could not hear it up-to-the-ear. Apple told us, after we described the problem over the telephone, that it was probably only the speaker module and it would cost about $50. I recently took it to Apple to have the module replaced and was told by them that several parts inside the phone was missing and some parts did not even belong to Apple. Because of the modifications, Apple said that it was no longer a iPhone and would not even work on it.

I was a bit skeptical purchasing this because it came out in 2013, but I am not a big fan of the iPhone 6 it feels weird in my in my hands. Nevertheless, the iPhone 5s fits my needs it is very fast with a 64 bit processor (this really helps with games and day to day usage). I really recommend this phone if you are looking for a speedy, affordable, and usage with one hand. But before you purchase you should really look at technical reviews of this phone they may be worth your while many of them show day to day usage. But if you are a little bit more technical and understand benchmark performance tests I.E. Antutu, geekbench etc... These will show it's raw performance (if you understand the numbers) if you don't it's fine the simplest way I can put it is higher is better.Also I want to say which seller I bought it from not really sure if they have any more in stock but I bought from textbook rush.

It is very disappointing to get the phone, (which I had to go to the post office to pick up), then go to the Verizon store to get the phone configured, and have Verizon tell me the phone is NOT a Verizon phone. Not to mention that while at the Verizon store, I received information that this price is way to high for this model. True, determining price fairness is ultimately my responsibility, but it sure would be nice if products listed here always have a good degree of fairness in there pricing.Anyway, main complaint - WRONG phone - it is NOT a Verizon phone as it is advertised - I need to return it and shop again for the proper phone.",2

I was on the Boost Sprint network which had spotty coverage in my area.verizon has a $45 pre paid plan which is working quite well for me so far.now to the iPhone 5 s: I really like the 4 inch screen, the iPhone fits in my hand and it is easier to navigate all the apps. I find typing with the keyboard much easier. I always had trouble using the keyboard on my galaxy s3, even with different keyboards. the iPhone is not as customizable as android but I can live with that. so far, the battery has lasted over 2 days and is still at 32%. this is since I activated it 2 days ago.True, I am still setting it up but I will manually sync my iPhone with iTunes. my android phone was driving me nuts, always updating several times a day from google play. my battery lasted around 1 1/2 to 2 days. if the iPhone is similar, I will be happy. all in all I am very pleased with my new, pre owned iPhone 5s. buying from amazon warehouse or fulfilled by amazon is the way to go!",10

The bottom of the screen is unusable as a touchpad. I cannot send text without turning the home. I cannot open voicemail, contacts. Recents or favorites because the bottom of the screen is broken. Sometimes out of the blue the phone just starts going jibberish. And it doesn't stop until I shut the phone down. Everyone one of my collegues first made fun of my phone but now seem to as mad about as I am. This phone was not only a waste of money but has made my life extremely difficult. It sucks!

The colors are WAY brighter and more vivid than the 4s. It's actually off putting at times. I dread getting a text from someone who doesn't use iMessages because the green is SO bright. It's slimmer and smaller than the 4s, which is part of the general appeal, but it's taken me some getting used to. The camera, both front-facing and back, are way better than the 4s too. I haven't taken that many pictures but the ones I have were awesome (and I took some great ones with my 4s). I feel like there are more options to customize on this one than the 4s, too, even though without jailbreaking your phone it's still pretty standard Apple stuff. I just shove all the pre-installed apps I don't like into a folder and never touch it.",4

Apple iPhone 5s 32GB (Space Gray) - Verizon Wireless,Apple,49,5,"Great product.I think the good and bad of iPhone 5S are well known and I won't dwell on them here.I had an iPhone 4S and wanted to upgrade to a newer model with more storage 64 gb and didn't want to get iPhone 6. Since 64gb is discontinued on new models of iPhone 5S from Apple, the only way to get it is through resellers like Amazon. I highly recommend Amazon warehouse deals, because you can return them if not satisfied. I initially got iPhone 5 and returned it without trouble.

Bought from Amazon/Cell cow since Verizon Wireless store only had 16GB refurbished equivalent at most expensive price.

If your 4, like mine, got slow with iOS-7, the 5S will restore the snappy performance of earlier iOS versions. I have not found any area where I think the 4 was better. I guess a 6 would be nicer yet, but not worth the extra dosh for me. Note that unlike earlier Verizon compatible CDMA phones, the 5s does require a SIM card from Verizon to operate. You won't be able to use the phone at all without one. Verizon provided this to me at no charge.",3

We activated it on Verizon, and Verizon provided the SIM Card at no charge. They said that they always provide free SIM Cards at their Verizon Corporate stores.

Apple iPhone 5s 32GB (Space Gray) - Verizon Wireless,Apple,49,5,"You know, I was very skeptical of getting a used iPhone on Amazon.I wasn't sure about anything when buying this phone.

I needed a phone pretty quickly, so I chose it based on the fact that it was PRIME eligible and the seller had ~90% positive rating. I took my chances.Well, the phone came in great condition. Hardly any scratches. The iPhone met the expectations of the sellers ""very good"" condition it was stated to be in. I hurried towards a corporate Verizon store (corporate stores won't charge for SIM cards) and had them transfer my account info and number over to the iPhone. It took about 10 minutes.Overall, I am happy with my purchase, even though I was skeptical at first. I had no problems with anything.",1

The colors are WAY brighter and more vivid than the 4s. It's actually off putting at times. I dread getting a text from someone who doesn't use iMessages because the green is SO bright. It's slimmer and smaller than the 4s, which is part of the general appeal, but it's taken me some getting used to. The camera, both front-facing and back, are way better than the 4s too. I haven't taken that many pictures but the ones I have were awesome (and I took some great ones with my 4s). I feel like there are more options to customize on this one than the 4s, too, even though without jailbreaking your phone it's still pretty standard Apple stuff.

I can gladly say that I wasn't disappointed at all!! The phone I purchased matched the description and was everything I had hoped for! The phone itself didn't have any visible scratches that I could see and complain about and I could tell the previous owner took very good care of it! I got my package right on time and it was an excellent upgrade from my iPhone 4 and I definitely recommend purchasing from Valerie (the seller)!

I waited about a month before writing this to make sure I didn't run into any unexpected quirks. The phone itself was in beautiful condition, as described. It gets really warm though.

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Gold) - Verizon Wireless,Apple,239.95,1,"I purchased an iPhone 5s from MassTechtronics, and I am very unsatisfied. The Post said that there were no problems with the phone. When I got the phone, it already had problems. It keeps freezing up, and turning off. Every time I try to text someone, it tries to do the typing itself. Any time I am on social media, it Scrolls through the posts and likes things by itself. To fix it, I have to lock and unlock the screen every few seconds. Most of the time, I can't even unlock the screen. I have to restart the phone sometimes.",12

When I first was checking how the batter life was, i thought it was ok, because it lasted 3 days until it died. It was only after we bought the plan, sim card, and other accessories to set up the phone, that it began to die in less than an hour. But other than that, very small scratches hardly can notice them, and not laggy what so ever. Just annoyed with how we have to spend $15 or more on a new battery and kit... Very annoyed.",0

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Gold) - Verizon Wireless,Apple,239.95,4,"This is a good little phone to have if you aren't about wasting money trying to keep up with Apple on how fast they come out with a new phone. But this little phone does have some cool things that are to be considered; Its built with a CPU that supports 64 Bit, which is new (in my perspective when it comes to the mobile market) that is all I see that is beneficial. (but that is just me). other than that. the one that I bought here, someone replaced the screen and they forgot to replace the adhesive and so the digitizer likes to pop up and stuff and the home button broke too so that was fun. but over all, the phone is solid, the buyer is kind of.....strange but never the less, has provided a product of quality.",0

It is very disappointing to get the phone, (which I had to go to the post office to pick up), then go to the Verizon store to get the phone configured, and have Verizon tell me the phone is NOT a Verizon phone. Not to mention that while at the Verizon store, I received information that this price is way to high for this model. True, determining price fairness is ultimately my responsibility, but it sure would be nice if products listed here always have a good degree of fairness in there pricing.Anyway, main complaint - WRONG phone - it is NOT a Verizon phone as it is advertised - I need to return it and shop again for the proper phone.",1

The company told me to kick rocks since their warranty period is 30 days. Now the screen is 95% unresponsive, text keyboard doesn't work, and luckily I can use Siri to make phone calls and text (can't answer the phone most of the time).

I find typing with the keyboard much easier. I always had trouble using the keyboard on my galaxy s3, even with different keyboards. the iPhone is not as customizable as android but I can live with that. so far, the battery has lasted over 2 days and is still at 32%. this is since I activated it 2 days ago.True, I am still setting it up but I will manually sync my iPhone with iTunes. my android phone was driving me nuts, always updating several times a day from google play. my battery lasted around 1 1/2 to 2 days. if the iPhone is similar, I will be happy. all in all I am very pleased with my new, pre owned iPhone 5s. buying from amazon warehouse or fulfilled by amazon is the way to go!",10

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Gold) - Verizon Wireless,Apple,239.95,5,"Very happy with this 5S 64GB iPhone. We had expected the prices on the 5S 64GB to drop significantly after the iPhone 6 came out. But the issues with the iPhone 6 immediately after launch caused the 5S 64GB to stay in demand. We were happy to find it here, and at a good price. We activated it on Verizon, and Verizon provided the SIM Card at no charge. They said that they always provide free SIM Cards at their Verizon Corporate stores. Reviews that mention the fact that you need to get a SIM Card to go with this phone may be unaware that Verizon customers can take it to a Verizon Corporate store to have it activated and get the SIM Card at no charge.",87

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Gold) - Verizon Wireless,Apple,239.95,5,"I mean it's an iPhone. It's easy to use, sleek, syncs with my Macbook Pro, and does everything I need it to do. The colors are WAY brighter and more vivid than the 4s. It's actually off putting at times. I dread getting a text from someone who doesn't use iMessages because the green is SO bright. It's slimmer and smaller than the 4s, which is part of the general appeal, but it's taken me some getting used to. The camera, both front-facing and back, are way better than the 4s too. I haven't taken that many pictures but the ones I have were awesome (and I took some great ones with my 4s). I feel like there are more options to customize on this one than the 4s, too, even though without jailbreaking your phone it's still pretty standard Apple stuff. I just shove all the pre-installed apps I don't like into a folder and never touch it.",4

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Gold) - Verizon Wireless,Apple,239.95,5,"Great product.I think the good and bad of iPhone 5S are well known and I won't dwell on them here.I had an iPhone 4S and wanted to upgrade to a newer model with more storage 64 gb and didn't want to get iPhone 6. Since 64gb is discontinued on new models of iPhone 5S from Apple, the only way to get it is through resellers like Amazon. I highly recommend Amazon warehouse deals, because you can return them if not satisfied. I initially got iPhone 5 and returned it without trouble. This one, I will keep, because it works well and suits my needs.",1

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Gold) - Verizon Wireless,Apple,239.95,5,"You know, I was very skeptical of getting a used iPhone on Amazon.I wasn't sure about anything when buying this phone. It was sold by a seller named 'K&K Realty' and had no other descriptors other than that the phone was in ""very good"" condition. I needed a phone pretty quickly, so I chose it based on the fact that it was PRIME eligible and the seller had ~90% positive rating. I took my chances.Well, the phone came in great condition. Hardly any scratches. The iPhone met the expectations of the sellers ""very good"" condition it was stated to be in. I hurried towards a corporate Verizon store (corporate stores won't charge for SIM cards) and had them transfer my account info and number over to the iPhone. It took about 10 minutes.Overall, I am happy with my purchase, even though I was skeptical at first. I had no problems with anything.",1

I waited about a month before writing this to make sure I didn't run into any unexpected quirks. The phone itself was in beautiful condition, as described. It gets really warm though.

Buying refurbished it was easy to afford 64 GB, able to hold and manage my large music and photo/video libraries. As soon as I started it up it began synchronizing with my two Apple laptops, and now is continuously updated, and all devices are able to use the Apple system transparently, including iCloud iTunes and the many good supported apps. I bought the 5s because it's the right size for me. It fits easily in any pocket. The pictures are good enough that I almost never use my digital cameras.

If you keep your phone locked, the fingerprint ID alone is worth the upgrade. One touch and you're in! Punching in a code every time you want to access your phone seems so archaic. All the other features are just icing on top. I'm one of those who is just not into this current fad of gargantuan cell phones just to have a big screen. I loved the size of the 4, and after having the 5 for awhile I think it's the perfect size. Still easy to ""one-hand"" the phone and still easily slips into your front jeans pocket.

Everything was sealed with plastic protector. Considering the price, this is a amazing deal. You can probably get one from eBay for about $400 but that usually does not include accessories and the phone itself is in ""New (other)"" condition, whatever that means.Activation took about 3 minutes in the t-mobile store.The phone does not come with a t-mobile logo though. I am not sure if it actually was made for some other carriers, or even overseas. But so far so good, I will update this in a month if anybody is interested.OK, it's been almost a month. Everything still good. My daughter loves the games on it. And my wife is satisfied with the battery life. Just for curiosity, I checked the ESN at Apple website and gladly found it is under warranty until next July. I guess I just got good luck.",2

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Gold) -T-Mobile,Apple,265,2,"First let me identify the seller ""Phone-Zone"". So many people complain about a seller, but they don't give the name.First the phone (IPhone 5s) took longer than normal to get here, but the weathers been bad, so ok. The real problem was that while everything stated by the seller and Amazon on the website, receipt and labeling, implied that the phone was new and T-Mobile ready, is now in doubt. I was unable to activate the phone with my carrier T-Mobile because the SIM was unusable or not installed. After some trouble I was able to get the SIM cover off, and there was a T-Mobile SIM installed. So the SIM is either defective or had been activated before. So no phone.I am driving the 30 miles to my local T-Mobile store tomorrow, to try and get the phone working, and to find out its history. I'm hoping they're good with IPhones, because while working over the phone with T-Mobile to resolve the problem, the SIM card became jammed in the IPhone (poor design). SO NO PHONE!When you spend the kind of money Apple asks for their products, you expect more. I've owned three Apple products, including this one, and had problems with two of the three. That's Not Good.Overall, I give the 5s just 2 stars and the seller Phone-Zone 0 stars.",5

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Gold) -T-Mobile,Apple,265,5,"I was a little skeptical at first about buying this phone from amazon because i got it at the price $499 (brand new!! Sealed) but i couldn't be happier! The phone of course is running ios 7 straight from the box and the touch i.d is probably the best thing ever. If you're debating whether to get the 5c or 5s definitely spend a little more for the 5s its totally worth it. The camera is great. Extremely fast and extremely clear. There are new options on it like the slomo effect which is fun to play with. The dual tone flash takes mobile picture taking to a whole other level. The best camera on a phone in the market. Take that from someone who has had a galaxy note 2 and samsung galaxy s3. The screen size is something people might not want to over look. If you have extremely big hands i would say go in store and try it out, see how well you can operate it. But its definitely ""one handable"" meaning you can use it with only one hand and not ever have to over stretch. The resolution is crystal clear, no doubt about that. Although the phone is 1.2 ghz it is blazing fast. It is a 64 bit. I can play heavy games like GTA and not ever freeze on me, even with lots of apps running in the background. Battery life is as expected when dealing with apple. But one thing i have noticed standby times are incredibly great. I can go to sleep with my phone at 100% and wake up and its at 99% sometimes still 100%. This phone is not ""droppable"" you'll have lucky moments when you drop it and it doesn't shatter but if it falls too high and too hard or at the wrong angle, your screen will be gone. Though I've had mine for over a month I haven't cracked it because i always keep it in a case. So invest in something protective like a speck case or otterbox or some generics.",56

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Gold) -T-Mobile,Apple,265,5,"This phone was a major transition from android based phones. After 2 weeks of really getting accustomed to this Apple iPhone it really changed the perspective I have of apple. First, it is pricey but worth the investment because of its smoothness, quality, and warm feeling of ownership it gives you. Second, battery life was an substantial improvement over many android phones I have owned that do not have a problem draining on your time. Siri is awesome and a person that does not use vocal command devices will have a great time with issuing out commands and asking questions.My only cons are I wish that many android based apps were transferrable but no complaints because the way technology is common to adaptation and delivering the very best to its consumers it'll only be a matter of time.The screen display is excellent but unfortunately this phone isn't as big either compared to other ultra smartphones but definitely makes up with its sleek traditionalistic screen and clarity.

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Gold) -T-Mobile,Apple,265,1,"I'm going to be honest I'm not going to give you this long 20 page review. I'm just going to say, it's not the best to get your phone here cause you have no plan or anything like that. My phone came in like brand new, except for the small problem. My phone would start turning off randomly after 2 months of getting it. It wasn't that bad until a month later it got so bad I couldn't be on my phone for 3 minutes without it turning it off. A little after that it would turn on but stay on the apple then turn off. I couldn't be on my phone at all. I had to get it fixed for $60 not a lot , but this is when they raised the price and I had to pay $310 for my phone. I found out a piece inside my phone would heat up so bad it would turn my phone off. When they fixed it I had to restart my phone. I hope my review helped you guys out :)",3

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Gold) -T-Mobile,Apple,265,5,"It's a very great device. I was a bit skeptical purchasing this because it came out in 2013, but I am not a big fan of the iPhone 6 it feels weird in my in my hands. Nevertheless, the iPhone 5s fits my needs it is very fast with a 64 bit processor (this really helps with games and day to day usage). I really recommend this phone if you are looking for a speedy, affordable, and usage with one hand. But before you purchase you should really look at technical reviews of this phone they may be worth your while many of them show day to day usage. But if you are a little bit more technical and understand benchmark performance tests I.E. Antutu, geekbench etc... These will show it's raw performance (if you understand the numbers) if you don't it's fine the simplest way I can put it is higher is better.Also I want to say which seller I bought it from not really sure if they have any more in stock but I bought from textbook rush.

I recently took it to Apple to have the module replaced and was told by them that several parts inside the phone was missing and some parts did not even belong to Apple.

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Gold) -T-Mobile,Apple,265,1,"This phone was bought as a birthday gift.(I didnt open the package to inspect because I assumed it was new and nothing to worry about. It was sealed in plastic) The first thing the birthday girl noticed was the dust under the screen, stickers everywhere and the knock off charger. She over looked it because the phone worked. Two days later the phone stopped working and she asked if the phone was used. After taking the phone into tmobile together, they confirmed the phone was used and the imei # is blocked from their network (that means either stolen/owing money/fraud). In other words they cant help me and I should return it. Went home to pack the phone back in the box and arrange to return it then I noticed the stickers I mentioned earlier were actually meant to hide info on the box. Long story short, the box is not for this phone. The imei on the sticker is different to the one on the box. So this seller got an old box, printed stickers to match the imei/specs of the phone and placed it over the info on the box. Do not buy from this person. If you do make sure to ask for that IMEI first. Here's some pictures just in case they plan to re-sell the same phone without being honest. I blacked out the end of the imei for security reasons but it's clear the both numbers don't match. Worst purchase ever!!!!!",48

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Silver) - T-Mobile,Apple,265,1,"I'm going to be honest I'm not going to give you this long 20 page review. I'm just going to say, it's not the best to get your phone here cause you have no plan or anything like that. My phone came in like brand new, except for the small problem. My phone would start turning off randomly after 2 months of getting it. It wasn't that bad until a month later it got so bad I couldn't be on my phone for 3 minutes without it turning it off. A little after that it would turn on but stay on the apple then turn off. I couldn't be on my phone at all. I had to get it fixed for $60 not a lot , but this is when they raised the price and I had to pay $310 for my phone. I found out a piece inside my phone would heat up so bad it would turn my phone off. When they fixed it I had to restart my phone. I hope my review helped you guys out :)",3

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Silver) - T-Mobile,Apple,265,2,"First let me identify the seller ""Phone-Zone"". So many people complain about a seller, but they don't give the name.First the phone (IPhone 5s) took longer than normal to get here, but the weathers been bad, so ok. The real problem was that while everything stated by the seller and Amazon on the website, receipt and labeling, implied that the phone was new and T-Mobile ready, is now in doubt. I was unable to activate the phone with my carrier T-Mobile because the SIM was unusable or not installed. After some trouble I was able to get the SIM cover off, and there was a T-Mobile SIM installed. So the SIM is either defective or had been activated before. So no phone.I am driving the 30 miles to my local T-Mobile store tomorrow, to try and get the phone working, and to find out its history. I'm hoping they're good with IPhones, because while working over the phone with T-Mobile to resolve the problem, the SIM card became jammed in the IPhone (poor design). SO NO PHONE!When you spend the kind of money Apple asks for their products, you expect more. I've owned three Apple products, including this one, and had problems with two of the three. That's Not Good.Overall, I give the 5s just 2 stars and the seller Phone-Zone 0 stars.",5

The gold color on the back is very light, more like a champagne color, but it's a very unique and unseen color for any phone, which makes, whoever buys it, stand out and unique. it's an iPhone, so that only means that it's synonymous with greatness! I love the new, fresh OS that came preloaded on the device, and the hardware is excellent too, especially the newly-debuted fingerprint reader.

As soon as I started it up it began synchronizing with my two Apple laptops, and now is continuously updated, and all devices are able to use the Apple system transparently, including iCloud iTunes and the many good supported apps.

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Silver) - T-Mobile,Apple,265,5,"This phone was a major transition from android based phones. After 2 weeks of really getting accustomed to this Apple iPhone it really changed the perspective I have of apple. First, it is pricey but worth the investment because of its smoothness, quality, and warm feeling of ownership it gives you. Second, battery life was an substantial improvement over many android phones I have owned that do not have a problem draining on your time. Siri is awesome and a person that does not use vocal command devices will have a great time with issuing out commands and asking questions.My only cons are I wish that many android based apps were transferrable but no complaints because the way technology is common to adaptation and delivering the very best to its consumers it'll only be a matter of time.The screen display is excellent but unfortunately this phone isn't as big either compared to other ultra smartphones but definitely makes up with its sleek traditionalistic screen and clarity. I think if you can afford this product and need a device that can be used wonderfully in a personal or professional setting then this is where it's at.",0

I was a bit skeptical purchasing this because it came out in 2013, but I am not a big fan of the iPhone 6 it feels weird in my in my hands. Nevertheless, the iPhone 5s fits my needs it is very fast with a 64 bit processor (this really helps with games and day to day usage). I really recommend this phone if you are looking for a speedy, affordable, and usage with one hand. But before you purchase you should really look at technical reviews of this phone they may be worth your while many of them show day to day usage. But if you are a little bit more technical and understand benchmark performance tests I.E. Antutu, geekbench etc... These will show it's raw performance (if you understand the numbers) if you don't it's fine the simplest way I can put it is higher is better.Also I want to say which seller I bought it from not really sure if they have any more in stock but I bought from textbook rush.

No matter what trick I tried (I've read all the message boards), the camera on this phone simply will not focus. Overall, I don't recommend purchasing this item. Just go to an Apple store and get the iPhone S. Yes, it will cost you about $150 more, but it's well worth the extra money. I ended up doing that after having this phone for only 2 months. The camera feature is too important to me. Plus, if you purchase a new phone, you'll have the warranty and protection. Buying this particular phone from this particular company is very risky.",0

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Silver) - T-Mobile,Apple,265,5,"I was a little skeptical at first about buying this phone from amazon because i got it at the price $499 (brand new!! Sealed) but i couldn't be happier! The phone of course is running ios 7 straight from the box and the touch i.d is probably the best thing ever. If you're debating whether to get the 5c or 5s definitely spend a little more for the 5s its totally worth it. The camera is great. Extremely fast and extremely clear. There are new options on it like the slomo effect which is fun to play with. The dual tone flash takes mobile picture taking to a whole other level. The best camera on a phone in the market. Take that from someone who has had a galaxy note 2 and samsung galaxy s3. The screen size is something people might not want to over look. If you have extremely big hands i would say go in store and try it out, see how well you can operate it. But its definitely ""one handable"" meaning you can use it with only one hand and not ever have to over stretch. The resolution is crystal clear, no doubt about that. Although the phone is 1.2 ghz it is blazing fast. It is a 64 bit. I can play heavy games like GTA and not ever freeze on me, even with lots of apps running in the background. Battery life is as expected when dealing with apple. But one thing i have noticed standby times are incredibly great. I can go to sleep with my phone at 100% and wake up and its at 99% sometimes still 100%. This phone is not ""droppable"" you'll have lucky moments when you drop it and it doesn't shatter but if it falls too high and too hard or at the wrong angle, your screen will be gone. Though I've had mine for over a month I haven't cracked it because i always keep it in a case. So invest in something protective like a speck case or otterbox or some generics.",56

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Silver) - T-Mobile,Apple,265,1,"This phone was bought as a birthday gift.(I didnt open the package to inspect because I assumed it was new and nothing to worry about. It was sealed in plastic) The first thing the birthday girl noticed was the dust under the screen, stickers everywhere and the knock off charger. She over looked it because the phone worked. Two days later the phone stopped working and she asked if the phone was used. After taking the phone into tmobile together, they confirmed the phone was used and the imei # is blocked from their network (that means either stolen/owing money/fraud). In other words they cant help me and I should return it. Went home to pack the phone back in the box and arrange to return it then I noticed the stickers I mentioned earlier were actually meant to hide info on the box. Long story short, the box is not for this phone. The imei on the sticker is different to the one on the box. So this seller got an old box, printed stickers to match the imei/specs of the phone and placed it over the info on the box. Do not buy from this person. If you do make sure to ask for that IMEI first. Here's some pictures just in case they plan to re-sell the same phone without being honest. I blacked out the end of the imei for security reasons but it's clear the both numbers don't match. Worst purchase ever!!!!!",49

Everything was sealed with plastic protector. Considering the price, this is a amazing deal. You can probably get one from eBay for about $400 but that usually does not include accessories and the phone itself is in ""New (other)"" condition, whatever that means.Activation took about 3 minutes in the t-mobile store.The phone does not come with a t-mobile logo though. I am not sure if it actually was made for some other carriers, or even overseas. But so far so good, I will update this in a month if anybody is interested.OK, it's been almost a month. Everything still good. My daughter loves the games on it. And my wife is satisfied with the battery life. Just for curiosity, I checked the ESN at Apple website and gladly found it is under warranty until next July. I guess I just got good luck.",2

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Space Gray) - T-Mobile,Apple,92.86,5,"I was a little skeptical at first about buying this phone from amazon because i got it at the price $499 (brand new!! Sealed) but i couldn't be happier! The phone of course is running ios 7 straight from the box and the touch i.d is probably the best thing ever. If you're debating whether to get the 5c or 5s definitely spend a little more for the 5s its totally worth it. The camera is great. Extremely fast and extremely clear. There are new options on it like the slomo effect which is fun to play with. The dual tone flash takes mobile picture taking to a whole other level. The best camera on a phone in the market. Take that from someone who has had a galaxy note 2 and samsung galaxy s3. The screen size is something people might not want to over look. If you have extremely big hands i would say go in store and try it out, see how well you can operate it. But its definitely ""one handable"" meaning you can use it with only one hand and not ever have to over stretch. The resolution is crystal clear, no doubt about that. Although the phone is 1.2 ghz it is blazing fast. It is a 64 bit. I can play heavy games like GTA and not ever freeze on me, even with lots of apps running in the background. Battery life is as expected when dealing with apple. But one thing i have noticed standby times are incredibly great. I can go to sleep with my phone at 100% and wake up and its at 99% sometimes still 100%. This phone is not ""droppable"" you'll have lucky moments when you drop it and it doesn't shatter but if it falls too high and too hard or at the wrong angle, your screen will be gone. Though I've had mine for over a month I haven't cracked it because i always keep it in a case. So invest in something protective like a speck case or otterbox or some generics.",56

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Space Gray) - T-Mobile,Apple,92.86,2,"First let me identify the seller ""Phone-Zone"". So many people complain about a seller, but they don't give the name.First the phone (IPhone 5s) took longer than normal to get here, but the weathers been bad, so ok. The real problem was that while everything stated by the seller and Amazon on the website, receipt and labeling, implied that the phone was new and T-Mobile ready, is now in doubt. I was unable to activate the phone with my carrier T-Mobile because the SIM was unusable or not installed. After some trouble I was able to get the SIM cover off, and there was a T-Mobile SIM installed. So the SIM is either defective or had been activated before. So no phone.I am driving the 30 miles to my local T-Mobile store tomorrow, to try and get the phone working, and to find out its history. I'm hoping they're good with IPhones, because while working over the phone with T-Mobile to resolve the problem, the SIM card became jammed in the IPhone (poor design). SO NO PHONE!When you spend the kind of money Apple asks for their products, you expect more. I've owned three Apple products, including this one, and had problems with two of the three. That's Not Good.Overall, I give the 5s just 2 stars and the seller Phone-Zone 0 stars.",5

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Space Gray) - T-Mobile,Apple,92.86,5,"This phone was a major transition from android based phones. After 2 weeks of really getting accustomed to this Apple iPhone it really changed the perspective I have of apple. First, it is pricey but worth the investment because of its smoothness, quality, and warm feeling of ownership it gives you. Second, battery life was an substantial improvement over many android phones I have owned that do not have a problem draining on your time. Siri is awesome and a person that does not use vocal command devices will have a great time with issuing out commands and asking questions.My only cons are I wish that many android based apps were transferrable but no complaints because the way technology is common to adaptation and delivering the very best to its consumers it'll only be a matter of time.The screen display is excellent but unfortunately this phone isn't as big either compared to other ultra smartphones but definitely makes up with its sleek traditionalistic screen and clarity. I think if you can afford this product and need a device that can be used wonderfully in a personal or professional setting then this is where it's at.",0

A little after that it would turn on but stay on the apple then turn off. I couldn't be on my phone at all. I had to get it fixed for $60 not a lot , but this is when they raised the price and I had to pay $310 for my phone.

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Space Gray) - T-Mobile,Apple,92.86,5,"It's a very great device. I was a bit skeptical purchasing this because it came out in 2013, but I am not a big fan of the iPhone 6 it feels weird in my in my hands. Nevertheless, the iPhone 5s fits my needs it is very fast with a 64 bit processor (this really helps with games and day to day usage). I really recommend this phone if you are looking for a speedy, affordable, and usage with one hand. But before you purchase you should really look at technical reviews of this phone they may be worth your while many of them show day to day usage. But if you are a little bit more technical and understand benchmark performance tests I.E. Antutu, geekbench etc... These will show it's raw performance (if you understand the numbers) if you don't it's fine the simplest way I can put it is higher is better.Also I want to say which seller I bought it from not really sure if they have any more in stock but I bought from textbook rush.

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Space Gray) - T-Mobile,Apple,92.86,1,"This phone was bought as a birthday gift.(I didnt open the package to inspect because I assumed it was new and nothing to worry about. It was sealed in plastic) The first thing the birthday girl noticed was the dust under the screen, stickers everywhere and the knock off charger. She over looked it because the phone worked. Two days later the phone stopped working and she asked if the phone was used. After taking the phone into tmobile together, they confirmed the phone was used and the imei # is blocked from their network (that means either stolen/owing money/fraud). In other words they cant help me and I should return it. Went home to pack the phone back in the box and arrange to return it then I noticed the stickers I mentioned earlier were actually meant to hide info on the box. Long story short, the box is not for this phone. The imei on the sticker is different to the one on the box. So this seller got an old box, printed stickers to match the imei/specs of the phone and placed it over the info on the box. Do not buy from this person. If you do make sure to ask for that IMEI first. Here's some pictures just in case they plan to re-sell the same phone without being honest. I blacked out the end of the imei for security reasons but it's clear the both numbers don't match. Worst purchase ever!!!!!",48

I love the new, fresh OS that came preloaded on the device, and the hardware is excellent too, especially the newly-debuted fingerprint reader.

I am not sure if it actually was made for some other carriers, or even overseas. But so far so good, I will update this in a month if anybody is interested.OK, it's been almost a month.

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB Gold - AT&T,,399.95,5,"I notice most of the recent reviews are reviewing the sellers or condition of used phones rather than the product itself. So I thought I would touch upon a few things regarding this product.The iPhone 5s works great on latest 9.3.3 IOS and the one I purchased fully supports AT&T 4G LTE. The fingerprint recognition system is a handy feature and easy to set up. You can register up to 5 fingers. The iPhone 5s runs on a desktop class 64-bit A7 chip which is said to be twice as fast as iPhone 5.If you're looking at buying an iPhone 5s, price is definitely a main consideration. But do you buy new or used? That depends.Personally, after seeing new iPhone 5s priced at 400USD, I would and did explore other options. I was fortunate to purchase a like-new 64gb iPhone 5s for 265USD in absolutely pristine condition with equally pristine original box and all contents from the original owner through Amazon.Apple has discontinued the 5s but because many people prefer the 4"" screen of the iPhone 5s over the 4.7"" 6s or 5.5"" 6s Plus, Apple released the SE in March 2016. The 5se has the same 4"" screen as a 5s and a 64gb carries a 499USD price tag. The difference in specs may more than makes up for the difference in price if you are considering buying a brand new phone.iPhone SE: Apple A9 1.84GHz Dual-core 'Twister' CPU, PowerVR GT7600 six-core GPU, 2GB RAM, 1624 mAh battery. CAMERA: 12MP, f/2.2 aperture lens, 1/3"" sensor, 1.22 ¬µm pixel size, Live photos; 4K video, 240fps @ 720p slo-moiPhone 5S: Apple A7 1.3GHz Dual-core 'Cyclone' CPU, PowerVR G6430 quad-core GPU, 1GB RAM, 1560 mAh battery. CAMERA: 8MP, f/2.2 aperture lens, 1/3"" sensor, 1.5 ¬µm pixel size, 1080p video, 120fps @ 720p slo-moObviously the iPhone SE has newer features and faster CPU and GPU, but the iPhone 5s is no slouch. It's a great feature packed phone IF you can buy it at a competitive price. And that price should reflect the fact that the iPhone 5s was released in 2013, its big brothers in 2015 and the SE in 2016. So, at some point in the not too distant future, the 5s will become obsolete and it won't be able to upgrade to the latest IOS.I hope my review was helpful to you and to anyone else considering purchasing an iPhone 5s.",3

The phone did have a few scratches on it, but none on the screen itself, and my son didn't seem to care. To hook it up, all I did was take it to T-mobile (my cell phone carrier) and got sim card that fit it. After putting the in sim, it took me through the usual new cell phone set up and then it was good to go. Overall, I am pleased with the phone and my son absolutely loves it.",12

It is fast and easy to use. I love the display of it, especially when I am watch a movie. It's thinner and lighter than all cellphones I used to own. It is to carry in your packet or hold in your hand. I really like the fingerprint ring on home button which helps you to get in your phone quickly and it makes easy to access your cellphone. It takes less time to charge it which is more convenience to me and when the battery is full it last for long time. For instance, me I charge my iPhone once a day because the battery last for a day or two. Moreover, I love taking pictures with my iPhone because it has the best camera that I never had in my previous cellphone. it has HD camera that brings the quality I want. Furthermore, I listen to the music a lot, the speaker of iPhone 6s plus is good. it brings out the good sound that I enjoy it. Also, if you like to use headphone to listen to the music in the setting app you have opportunity to choose the type of sound you want to hear. For example, Pop, Rock, Jazz, etc.... Also it boost your base for certain amount when connected to a speaker or headphone. The touch screen is better than other phone I had before because it respond quick and doesn't delay.Although, its the best cellphone I ever have or use the price is kind high. For me its an expensive cellphone but the way it is and the way it woks it deserves to be expensive. I love everything about it for real.",0

"Apple iPhone 6S Plus Unlocked Smartphone, 32 GB (Gold)",Apple,749.99,5,"Upgrading my iPhone from 5S to 6Plus and now 6S Plus from T mobile ...Apple has never disappointed me..from silver to golden and now rose gold..my iPhone's are getting new colors day by day..everybody loves colors and apple has portrayed our color fascination in their new iPhone 6S Plus.Look wise 6 Plus and 6S Plus are mostly same but most added feature which makes it different are its 3D Touch with bright vibrant display ( but not as bright as Galaxy S6 Edge Plus) and of course addition of new color Rose Gold :)The best parts of iPhone 6S Plus which is my favorite also are :Lightning speed, 12 mp camera, Siri's sweet voice, 5.5 inch bigger resolution screen and pressure-sensitive 3D Touch display is a win win over 6 Plus.Battery life is slightly better in 6S Plus. Optical image stabilization for photos and video can surely make a difference ,deliver more blur-free photos in certain light conditions. Design wise It looks identical to the iPhone 6 Plus ,only difference is in size of 5.5 inch compared to 4.7 inch..and the small 'S' logo on the rear below the word 'iPhone' . It's slightly thicker than 6 Plus. Fingerprint resistant glass makes the screen smudge free.Now not so attractive aspects :Cost is higher than others.. flat rear and rounded metal edges makes it a bit fussy while gripping.In a nutshell I love this new avatar of iPhone created by Apple :)",

"Apple iPhone 6S Plus Unlocked Smartphone, 32 GB (Silver)",Apple,744.99,5,"Upgrading my iPhone from 5S to 6Plus and now 6S Plus from T mobile ...Apple has never disappointed me..from silver to golden and now rose gold..my iPhone's are getting new colors day by day..everybody loves colors and apple has portrayed our color fascination in their new iPhone 6S Plus.Look wise 6 Plus and 6S Plus are mostly same but most added feature which makes it different are its 3D Touch with bright vibrant display ( but not as bright as Galaxy S6 Edge Plus) and of course addition of new color Rose Gold :)The best parts of iPhone 6S Plus which is my favorite also are :Lightning speed, 12 mp camera, Siri's sweet voice, 5.5 inch bigger resolution screen and pressure-sensitive 3D Touch display is a win win over 6 Plus.Battery life is slightly better in 6S Plus. Optical image stabilization for photos and video can surely make a difference ,deliver more blur-free photos in certain light conditions. Design wise It looks identical to the iPhone 6 Plus ,only difference is in size of 5.5 inch compared to 4.7 inch..and the small 'S' logo on the rear below the word 'iPhone' . It's slightly thicker than 6 Plus. Fingerprint resistant glass makes the screen smudge free.Now not so attractive aspects :Cost is higher than others.. flat rear and rounded metal edges makes it a bit fussy while gripping.In a nutshell I love this new avatar of iPhone created by Apple :)",1

"Apple iPhone 6S Plus Unlocked Smartphone, 32 GB (Space Gray)",Apple,749.99,5,"I have been using an Apple iPhone 6s plus for 6 months now. its the most beautiful and nice phone I ever have. It is fast and easy to use. I love the display of it, especially when I am watch a movie. It's thinner and lighter than all cellphones I used to own. It is to carry in your packet or hold in your hand. I really like the fingerprint ring on home button which helps you to get in your phone quickly and it makes easy to access your cellphone. It takes less time to charge it which is more convenience to me and when the battery is full it last for long time. For instance, me I charge my iPhone once a day because the battery last for a day or two. Moreover, I love taking pictures with my iPhone because it has the best camera that I never had in my previous cellphone. it has HD camera that brings the quality I want. Furthermore, I listen to the music a lot, the speaker of iPhone 6s plus is good. it brings out the good sound that I enjoy it. Also, if you like to use headphone to listen to the music in the setting app you have opportunity to choose the type of sound you want to hear. For example, Pop, Rock, Jazz, etc.... Also it boost your base for certain amount when connected to a speaker or headphone. The touch screen is better than other phone I had before because it respond quick and doesn't delay.Although, its the best cellphone I ever have or use the price is kind high. For me its an expensive cellphone but the way it is and the way it woks it deserves to be expensive. I love everything about it for real.",0

"Apple iPhone 6S Plus Unlocked Smartphone, 32 GB (Space Gray)",Apple,749.99,5,"Upgrading my iPhone from 5S to 6Plus and now 6S Plus from T mobile ...Apple has never disappointed me..from silver to golden and now rose gold..my iPhone's are getting new colors day by day..everybody loves colors and apple has portrayed our color fascination in their new iPhone 6S Plus.Look wise 6 Plus and 6S Plus are mostly same but most added feature which makes it different are its 3D Touch with bright vibrant display ( but not as bright as Galaxy S6 Edge Plus) and of course addition of new color Rose Gold :)The best parts of iPhone 6S Plus which is my favorite also are :Lightning speed, 12 mp camera, Siri's sweet voice, 5.5 inch bigger resolution screen and pressure-sensitive 3D Touch display is a win win over 6 Plus.Battery life is slightly better in 6S Plus. Optical image stabilization for photos and video can surely make a difference ,deliver more blur-free photos in certain light conditions. Design wise It looks identical to the iPhone 6 Plus ,only difference is in size of 5.5 inch compared to 4.7 inch..and the small 'S' logo on the rear below the word 'iPhone' . It's slightly thicker than 6 Plus. Fingerprint resistant glass makes the screen smudge free.Now not so attractive aspects :Cost is higher than others.. flat rear and rounded metal edges makes it a bit fussy while gripping.In a nutshell I love this new avatar of iPhone created by Apple :)",1

"Apple iPhone 6S Plus Unlocked Smartphone, 32 GB (Space Gray)",Apple,749.99,5,"I have been using an Apple iPhone 6s plus for 6 months now. its the most beautiful and nice phone I ever have. It is fast and easy to use. I love the display of it, especially when I am watch a movie. It's thinner and lighter than all cellphones I used to own. It is to carry in your packet or hold in your hand. I really like the fingerprint ring on home button which helps you to get in your phone quickly and it makes easy to access your cellphone. It takes less time to charge it which is more convenience to me and when the battery is full it last for long time. For instance, me I charge my iPhone once a day because the battery last for a day or two. Moreover, I love taking pictures with my iPhone because it has the best camera that I never had in my previous cellphone. it has HD camera that brings the quality I want. Furthermore, I listen to the music a lot, the speaker of iPhone 6s plus is good. it brings out the good sound that I enjoy it. Also, if you like to use headphone to listen to the music in the setting app you have opportunity to choose the type of sound you want to hear. For example, Pop, Rock, Jazz, etc.... Also it boost your base for certain amount when connected to a speaker or headphone. The touch screen is better than other phone I had before because it respond quick and doesn't delay.Although, its the best cellphone I ever have or use the price is kind high. For me its an expensive cellphone but the way it is and the way it woks it deserves to be expensive. I love everything about it for real.",0

"Apple iPhone 6S Plus Unlocked Smartphone, 64 GB (Gold)",Apple,749.95,5,"Upgrading my iPhone from 5S to 6Plus and now 6S Plus from T mobile ...Apple has never disappointed me..from silver to golden and now rose gold..my iPhone's are getting new colors day by day..everybody loves colors and apple has portrayed our color fascination in their new iPhone 6S Plus.Look wise 6 Plus and 6S Plus are mostly same but most added feature which makes it different are its 3D Touch with bright vibrant display ( but not as bright as Galaxy S6 Edge Plus) and of course addition of new color Rose Gold :)The best parts of iPhone 6S Plus which is my favorite also are :Lightning speed, 12 mp camera, Siri's sweet voice, 5.5 inch bigger resolution screen and pressure-sensitive 3D Touch display is a win win over 6 Plus.Battery life is slightly better in 6S Plus. Optical image stabilization for photos and video can surely make a difference ,deliver more blur-free photos in certain light conditions. Design wise It looks identical to the iPhone 6 Plus ,only difference is in size of 5.5 inch compared to 4.7 inch..and the small 'S' logo on the rear below the word 'iPhone' . It's slightly thicker than 6 Plus. Fingerprint resistant glass makes the screen smudge free.Now not so attractive aspects :Cost is higher than others.. flat rear and rounded metal edges makes it a bit fussy while gripping.In a nutshell I love this new avatar of iPhone created by Apple :)",1

"Apple iPhone 6S Plus Unlocked Smartphone, 64 GB (Gold)",Apple,749.95,5,"I have been using an Apple iPhone 6s plus for 6 months now. its the most beautiful and nice phone I ever have. It is fast and easy to use. I love the display of it, especially when I am watch a movie. It's thinner and lighter than all cellphones I used to own. It is to carry in your packet or hold in your hand. I really like the fingerprint ring on home button which helps you to get in your phone quickly and it makes easy to access your cellphone. It takes less time to charge it which is more convenience to me and when the battery is full it last for long time. For instance, me I charge my iPhone once a day because the battery last for a day or two. Moreover, I love taking pictures with my iPhone because it has the best camera that I never had in my previous cellphone. it has HD camera that brings the quality I want. Furthermore, I listen to the music a lot, the speaker of iPhone 6s plus is good. it brings out the good sound that I enjoy it. Also, if you like to use headphone to listen to the music in the setting app you have opportunity to choose the type of sound you want to hear. For example, Pop, Rock, Jazz, etc.... Also it boost your base for certain amount when connected to a speaker or headphone. The touch screen is better than other phone I had before because it respond quick and doesn't delay.Although, its the best cellphone I ever have or use the price is kind high. For me its an expensive cellphone but the way it is and the way it woks it deserves to be expensive. I love everything about it for real.",0

"Apple iPhone 6S Plus Unlocked Smartphone, 64 GB (Gold)",Apple,749.95,5,"Upgrading my iPhone from 5S to 6Plus and now 6S Plus from T mobile ...Apple has never disappointed me..from silver to golden and now rose gold..my iPhone's are getting new colors day by day..everybody loves colors and apple has portrayed our color fascination in their new iPhone 6S Plus.Look wise 6 Plus and 6S Plus are mostly same but most added feature which makes it different are its 3D Touch with bright vibrant display ( but not as bright as Galaxy S6 Edge Plus) and of course addition of new color Rose Gold :)The best parts of iPhone 6S Plus which is my favorite also are :Lightning speed, 12 mp camera, Siri's sweet voice, 5.5 inch bigger resolution screen and pressure-sensitive 3D Touch display is a win win over 6 Plus.Battery life is slightly better in 6S Plus. Optical image stabilization for photos and video can surely make a difference ,deliver more blur-free photos in certain light conditions. Design wise It looks identical to the iPhone 6 Plus ,only difference is in size of 5.5 inch compared to 4.7 inch..and the small 'S' logo on the rear below the word 'iPhone' . It's slightly thicker than 6 Plus. Fingerprint resistant glass makes the screen smudge free.Now not so attractive aspects :Cost is higher than others.. flat rear and rounded metal edges makes it a bit fussy while gripping.In a nutshell I love this new avatar of iPhone created by Apple :)",

It is fast and easy to use. I love the display of it, especially when I am watch a movie. It's thinner and lighter than all cellphones I used to own. It is to carry in your packet or hold in your hand. I really like the fingerprint ring on home button which helps you to get in your phone quickly and it makes easy to access your cellphone. It takes less time to charge it which is more convenience to me and when the battery is full it last for long time. For instance, me I charge my iPhone once a day because the battery last for a day or two. Moreover, I love taking pictures with my iPhone because it has the best camera that I never had in my previous cellphone. it has HD camera that brings the quality I want. Furthermore, I listen to the music a lot, the speaker of iPhone 6s plus is good. it brings out the good sound that I enjoy it. Also, if you like to use headphone to listen to the music in the setting app you have opportunity to choose the type of sound you want to hear. For example, Pop, Rock, Jazz, etc.... Also it boost your base for certain amount when connected to a speaker or headphone. The touch screen is better than other phone I had before because it respond quick and doesn't delay.Although, its the best cellphone I ever have or use the price is kind high.

"Apple iPhone 6S Plus Unlocked Smartphone, 64 GB (Rose Gold)",Apple,26.41,5,"Upgrading my iPhone from 5S to 6Plus and now 6S Plus from T mobile ...Apple has never disappointed me..from silver to golden and now rose gold..my iPhone's are getting new colors day by day..everybody loves colors and apple has portrayed our color fascination in their new iPhone 6S Plus.Look wise 6 Plus and 6S Plus are mostly same but most added feature which makes it different are its 3D Touch with bright vibrant display ( but not as bright as Galaxy S6 Edge Plus) and of course addition of new color Rose Gold :)The best parts of iPhone 6S Plus which is my favorite also are :Lightning speed, 12 mp camera, Siri's sweet voice, 5.5 inch bigger resolution screen and pressure-sensitive 3D Touch display is a win win over 6 Plus.Battery life is slightly better in 6S Plus. Optical image stabilization for photos and video can surely make a difference ,deliver more blur-free photos in certain light conditions. Design wise It looks identical to the iPhone 6 Plus ,only difference is in size of 5.5 inch compared to 4.7 inch..and the small 'S' logo on the rear below the word 'iPhone' . It's slightly thicker than 6 Plus. Fingerprint resistant glass makes the screen smudge free.Now not so attractive aspects :Cost is higher than others.. flat rear and rounded metal edges makes it a bit fussy while gripping.In a nutshell I love this new avatar of iPhone created by Apple :)",1

"Apple iPhone 6S Plus Unlocked Smartphone, 64 GB (Silver)",Apple,769.99,5,"I have been using an Apple iPhone 6s plus for 6 months now. its the most beautiful and nice phone I ever have. It is fast and easy to use. I love the display of it, especially when I am watch a movie. It's thinner and lighter than all cellphones I used to own. It is to carry in your packet or hold in your hand. I really like the fingerprint ring on home button which helps you to get in your phone quickly and it makes easy to access your cellphone. It takes less time to charge it which is more convenience to me and when the battery is full it last for long time. For instance, me I charge my iPhone once a day because the battery last for a day or two. Moreover, I love taking pictures with my iPhone because it has the best camera that I never had in my previous cellphone. it has HD camera that brings the quality I want. Furthermore, I listen to the music a lot, the speaker of iPhone 6s plus is good. it brings out the good sound that I enjoy it. Also, if you like to use headphone to listen to the music in the setting app you have opportunity to choose the type of sound you want to hear. For example, Pop, Rock, Jazz, etc.... Also it boost your base for certain amount when connected to a speaker or headphone. The touch screen is better than other phone I had before because it respond quick and doesn't delay.Although, its the best cellphone I ever have or use the price is kind high. For me its an expensive cellphone but the way it is and the way it woks it deserves to be expensive. I love everything about it for real.",0

"Apple iPhone 6S Plus Unlocked Smartphone, 64 GB (Silver)",Apple,769.99,5,"Upgrading my iPhone from 5S to 6Plus and now 6S Plus from T mobile ...Apple has never disappointed me..from silver to golden and now rose gold..my iPhone's are getting new colors day by day..everybody loves colors and apple has portrayed our color fascination in their new iPhone 6S Plus.Look wise 6 Plus and 6S Plus are mostly same but most added feature which makes it different are its 3D Touch with bright vibrant display ( but not as bright as Galaxy S6 Edge Plus) and of course addition of new color Rose Gold :)The best parts of iPhone 6S Plus which is my favorite also are :Lightning speed, 12 mp camera, Siri's sweet voice, 5.5 inch bigger resolution screen and pressure-sensitive 3D Touch display is a win win over 6 Plus.Battery life is slightly better in 6S Plus. Optical image stabilization for photos and video can surely make a difference ,deliver more blur-free photos in certain light conditions. Design wise It looks identical to the iPhone 6 Plus ,only difference is in size of 5.5 inch compared to 4.7 inch..and the small 'S' logo on the rear below the word 'iPhone' . It's slightly thicker than 6 Plus. Fingerprint resistant glass makes the screen smudge free.Now not so attractive aspects :Cost is higher than others.. flat rear and rounded metal edges makes it a bit fussy while gripping.In a nutshell I love this new avatar of iPhone created by Apple :)",1

"Apple iPhone 6S Plus Unlocked Smartphone, 64 GB (Silver)",Apple,769.99,5,"Upgrading my iPhone from 5S to 6Plus and now 6S Plus from T mobile ...Apple has never disappointed me..from silver to golden and now rose gold..my iPhone's are getting new colors day by day..everybody loves colors and apple has portrayed our color fascination in their new iPhone 6S Plus.Look wise 6 Plus and 6S Plus are mostly same but most added feature which makes it different are its 3D Touch with bright vibrant display ( but not as bright as Galaxy S6 Edge Plus) and of course addition of new color Rose Gold :)The best parts of iPhone 6S Plus which is my favorite also are :Lightning speed, 12 mp camera, Siri's sweet voice, 5.5 inch bigger resolution screen and pressure-sensitive 3D Touch display is a win win over 6 Plus.Battery life is slightly better in 6S Plus. Optical image stabilization for photos and video can surely make a difference ,deliver more blur-free photos in certain light conditions. Design wise It looks identical to the iPhone 6 Plus ,only difference is in size of 5.5 inch compared to 4.7 inch..and the small 'S' logo on the rear below the word 'iPhone' . It's slightly thicker than 6 Plus. Fingerprint resistant glass makes the screen smudge free.Now not so attractive aspects :Cost is higher than others.. flat rear and rounded metal edges makes it a bit fussy while gripping.In a nutshell I love this new avatar of iPhone created by Apple :)",

It is fast and easy to use. I love the display of it, especially when I am watch a movie. It's thinner and lighter than all cellphones I used to own. It is to carry in your packet or hold in your hand. I really like the fingerprint ring on home button which helps you to get in your phone quickly and it makes easy to access your cellphone. It takes less time to charge it which is more convenience to me and when the battery is full it last for long time. For instance, me I charge my iPhone once a day because the battery last for a day or two. Moreover, I love taking pictures with my iPhone because it has the best camera that I never had in my previous cellphone. it has HD camera that brings the quality I want. Furthermore, I listen to the music a lot, the speaker of iPhone 6s plus is good. it brings out the good sound that I enjoy it. Also, if you like to use headphone to listen to the music in the setting app you have opportunity to choose the type of sound you want to hear. For example, Pop, Rock, Jazz, etc.... Also it boost your base for certain amount when connected to a speaker or headphone. The touch screen is better than other phone I had before because it respond quick and doesn't delay.Although, its the best cellphone I ever have or use the price is kind high. For me its an expensive cellphone but the way it is and the way it woks it deserves to be expensive. I love everything about it for real.",0

Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 128 GB - US Version (Gold),Apple,1039.95,5,"After a long wait the Iphone 7 is now here. Thanks Samsung for messing up the note 7 launch. I would prefer not suffering third degree burns when simply charging your device. Over 2.5 million devices have been recalled and multiple lawsuits claiming negligence on Samsung‚Äôs part has been filed for damages. So it looks like apple has a great opportunity here to win back consumers after the 6S failed to captivate the market place. The Iphone 7 is a stunning phone visually. I picked the jet black version as apple has done a nice job here with color design. Going back the design of the phone as we all know the headphone jack has been removed. I do own the apple earpods which work with this bluetooth like technology or whatever and connecting them has been a breeze and so was wearing them for an extended period of time. But still this integration is not perfect. I spent over 100 dollars on wired beats last year and now they cannot be used easily without spending even more money which I refuse to do. Also I do fear I may lose these earphones as they are quite small and can get lost within a backpack it looks like. I have no ideal how the market will react to this change but we will find out. You definitely can adapt to this major design change if you want to. All your volume buttons and power buttons appear to be in the same spot. The touch ID and home button are on the front at the bottom. Both of your volume and power buttons are on the side. The back is a little different now boasting a 12mp dual camera which does in fact produce some great shots that rival the samsung galaxy s7 and edge.Here are some more details on the specsLTE Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30Non expandable storage 16GB, 64GB, 256GB5.5 Retina HD 1920x1080 displayA10 Processor, IP 67Wide Angle and Telephoto ApertureIf you are wondering about IOS 10 well it comes stock with the Iphone 7 and with good reason. They made a lot of incremental changes that adds up. Emojis and gifs now come stock with the messenger app something facebook messenger had for a bit but it‚Äôs great to see apple join the bandwagon, siri can now be used with third party apps like linkedin and yelp, sony lyrics were added to apple music/itunes even voice mail transcription is available. Like usual gaming performance on IOS 10 is great games from asphalt 8 to modern combat 5 plays very well and man oh man do these versions look better than they do on android even with nouget‚Äôs vulkan api. They still don‚Äôt look as good as they do here. Overall I think I said a line that describes this phone perfectly. They made a lot of incremental changes that adds up in end. Considering the recent blunders of samsung this phone is definitely something you should consider this holiday season. Thanks very much for reading this review",10
Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 128 GB - US Version (Gold),Apple,1039.95,2,"____I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",270

Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 128 GB - US Version (Gold),Apple,1039.95,1,"I have been a fervent Samsung fan since the S4 but I finally got fed up with the appalling battery life on the S6 that I still have. As with all expensive phones I am careful - screen protector and case go on at the same time the phone comes out of the box. I made the jump to Apple because my family all have them and I travel abroad so much - making it easier to communicate within the iMessage environment.I have been using WhatsApp for years and thought the transition of transferring my messages from the backup would be easy. NO WAY. The only way to do it is to pay for third party software to get all your old messages transferred across. No big deal - just another $20.Then when the phone falls on the floor flat from a coffee table (about a foot tall) I paid no attention at the time. Later in the day I see that the screen is cracked! Seriously? After 2 weeks! I have dropped many of the Samsung phones over the years from higher places and awkward angles and the worst I have had is to change the screen protector. But nope this is a goner already. What happened to Cornings glass and all that good stuff? Have I bought a fake phone or is the build quality really that poor? For over $1000 I expect more but sadly I am not in the US at the moment. I am disgusted and obviously regret this purchase.**Update** Sadly the story gets worse. The crack has turned out to be water damage so even with insurance that is now another $100 to replace the phone! Water resistant does not mean water proof - well I know that but it is supposed to resist being wet in my pocket during a rain shower, right? Well apparently not. So honestly after watching videos of people sticking this phone into 1.5m of water for 30 minutes I am even more dumbfounded. Why bother labelling it water resistant at all - just keep the damn phone dry like before. One day they will have a waterproof phone - oh yes they already exist but not at Apple.",0

Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 128 GB - US Version (Rose Gold),Apple,1040.02,5,"After a long wait the Iphone 7 is now here. Thanks Samsung for messing up the note 7 launch. I would prefer not suffering third degree burns when simply charging your device. Over 2.5 million devices have been recalled and multiple lawsuits claiming negligence on Samsung‚Äôs part has been filed for damages. So it looks like apple has a great opportunity here to win back consumers after the 6S failed to captivate the market place. The Iphone 7 is a stunning phone visually. I picked the jet black version as apple has done a nice job here with color design. Going back the design of the phone as we all know the headphone jack has been removed. I do own the apple earpods which work with this bluetooth like technology or whatever and connecting them has been a breeze and so was wearing them for an extended period of time. But still this integration is not perfect. I spent over 100 dollars on wired beats last year and now they cannot be used easily without spending even more money which I refuse to do. Also I do fear I may lose these earphones as they are quite small and can get lost within a backpack it looks like. I have no ideal how the market will react to this change but we will find out. You definitely can adapt to this major design change if you want to. All your volume buttons and power buttons appear to be in the same spot. The touch ID and home button are on the front at the bottom. Both of your volume and power buttons are on the side. The back is a little different now boasting a 12mp dual camera which does in fact produce some great shots that rival the samsung galaxy s7 and edge.Here are some more details on the specsLTE Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30Non expandable storage 16GB, 64GB, 256GB5.5 Retina HD 1920x1080 displayA10 Processor, IP 67Wide Angle and Telephoto ApertureIf you are wondering about IOS 10 well it comes stock with the Iphone 7 and with good reason. They made a lot of incremental changes that adds up. Emojis and gifs now come stock with the messenger app something facebook messenger had for a bit but it‚Äôs great to see apple join the bandwagon, siri can now be used with third party apps like linkedin and yelp, sony lyrics were added to apple music/itunes even voice mail transcription is available. Like usual gaming performance on IOS 10 is great games from asphalt 8 to modern combat 5 plays very well and man oh man do these versions look better than they do on android even with nouget‚Äôs vulkan api. They still don‚Äôt look as good as they do here. Overall I think I said a line that describes this phone perfectly. They made a lot of incremental changes that adds up in end. Considering the recent blunders of samsung this phone is definitely something you should consider this holiday season. Thanks very much for reading this review",10
Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 128 GB - US Version (Rose Gold),Apple,1040.02,2,"____I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",265

Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 128 GB - US Version (Silver),Apple,1020,5,"After a long wait the Iphone 7 is now here. Thanks Samsung for messing up the note 7 launch. I would prefer not suffering third degree burns when simply charging your device. Over 2.5 million devices have been recalled and multiple lawsuits claiming negligence on Samsung‚Äôs part has been filed for damages. So it looks like apple has a great opportunity here to win back consumers after the 6S failed to captivate the market place. The Iphone 7 is a stunning phone visually. I picked the jet black version as apple has done a nice job here with color design. Going back the design of the phone as we all know the headphone jack has been removed. I do own the apple earpods which work with this bluetooth like technology or whatever and connecting them has been a breeze and so was wearing them for an extended period of time. But still this integration is not perfect. I spent over 100 dollars on wired beats last year and now they cannot be used easily without spending even more money which I refuse to do. Also I do fear I may lose these earphones as they are quite small and can get lost within a backpack it looks like. I have no ideal how the market will react to this change but we will find out. You definitely can adapt to this major design change if you want to. All your volume buttons and power buttons appear to be in the same spot. The touch ID and home button are on the front at the bottom. Both of your volume and power buttons are on the side. The back is a little different now boasting a 12mp dual camera which does in fact produce some great shots that rival the samsung galaxy s7 and edge.Here are some more details on the specsLTE Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30Non expandable storage 16GB, 64GB, 256GB5.5 Retina HD 1920x1080 displayA10 Processor, IP 67Wide Angle and Telephoto ApertureIf you are wondering about IOS 10 well it comes stock with the Iphone 7 and with good reason. They made a lot of incremental changes that adds up. Emojis and gifs now come stock with the messenger app something facebook messenger had for a bit but it‚Äôs great to see apple join the bandwagon, siri can now be used with third party apps like linkedin and yelp, sony lyrics were added to apple music/itunes even voice mail transcription is available. Like usual gaming performance on IOS 10 is great games from asphalt 8 to modern combat 5 plays very well and man oh man do these versions look better than they do on android even with nouget‚Äôs vulkan api. They still don‚Äôt look as good as they do here. Overall I think I said a line that describes this phone perfectly. They made a lot of incremental changes that adds up in end. Considering the recent blunders of samsung this phone is definitely something you should consider this holiday season. Thanks very much for reading this review",10
Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 128 GB - US Version (Silver),Apple,1020,2,"____I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",270

Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Gold),Apple,1157,1,"I have been a fervent Samsung fan since the S4 but I finally got fed up with the appalling battery life on the S6 that I still have. As with all expensive phones I am careful - screen protector and case go on at the same time the phone comes out of the box. I made the jump to Apple because my family all have them and I travel abroad so much - making it easier to communicate within the iMessage environment.I have been using WhatsApp for years and thought the transition of transferring my messages from the backup would be easy. NO WAY. The only way to do it is to pay for third party software to get all your old messages transferred across. No big deal - just another $20.Then when the phone falls on the floor flat from a coffee table (about a foot tall) I paid no attention at the time. Later in the day I see that the screen is cracked! Seriously? After 2 weeks! I have dropped many of the Samsung phones over the years from higher places and awkward angles and the worst I have had is to change the screen protector. But nope this is a goner already. What happened to Cornings glass and all that good stuff? Have I bought a fake phone or is the build quality really that poor? For over $1000 I expect more but sadly I am not in the US at the moment. I am disgusted and obviously regret this purchase.**Update** Sadly the story gets worse. The crack has turned out to be water damage so even with insurance that is now another $100 to replace the phone! Water resistant does not mean water proof - well I know that but it is supposed to resist being wet in my pocket during a rain shower, right? Well apparently not. So honestly after watching videos of people sticking this phone into 1.5m of water for 30 minutes I am even more dumbfounded. Why bother labelling it water resistant at all - just keep the damn phone dry like before. One day they will have a waterproof phone - oh yes they already exist but not at Apple.",0

Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Gold),Apple,1157,5,"After a long wait the Iphone 7 is now here. Thanks Samsung for messing up the note 7 launch. I would prefer not suffering third degree burns when simply charging your device. Over 2.5 million devices have been recalled and multiple lawsuits claiming negligence on Samsung‚Äôs part has been filed for damages. So it looks like apple has a great opportunity here to win back consumers after the 6S failed to captivate the market place. The Iphone 7 is a stunning phone visually. I picked the jet black version as apple has done a nice job here with color design. Going back the design of the phone as we all know the headphone jack has been removed. I do own the apple earpods which work with this bluetooth like technology or whatever and connecting them has been a breeze and so was wearing them for an extended period of time. But still this integration is not perfect. I spent over 100 dollars on wired beats last year and now they cannot be used easily without spending even more money which I refuse to do. Also I do fear I may lose these earphones as they are quite small and can get lost within a backpack it looks like. I have no ideal how the market will react to this change but we will find out. You definitely can adapt to this major design change if you want to. All your volume buttons and power buttons appear to be in the same spot. The touch ID and home button are on the front at the bottom. Both of your volume and power buttons are on the side. The back is a little different now boasting a 12mp dual camera which does in fact produce some great shots that rival the samsung galaxy s7 and edge.Here are some more details on the specsLTE Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30Non expandable storage 16GB, 64GB, 256GB5.5 Retina HD 1920x1080 displayA10 Processor, IP 67Wide Angle and Telephoto ApertureIf you are wondering about IOS 10 well it comes stock with the Iphone 7 and with good reason. They made a lot of incremental changes that adds up. Emojis and gifs now come stock with the messenger app something facebook messenger had for a bit but it‚Äôs great to see apple join the bandwagon, siri can now be used with third party apps like linkedin and yelp, sony lyrics were added to apple music/itunes even voice mail transcription is available. Like usual gaming performance on IOS 10 is great games from asphalt 8 to modern combat 5 plays very well and man oh man do these versions look better than they do on android even with nouget‚Äôs vulkan api. They still don‚Äôt look as good as they do here. Overall I think I said a line that describes this phone perfectly. They made a lot of incremental changes that adds up in end. Considering the recent blunders of samsung this phone is definitely something you should consider this holiday season. Thanks very much for reading this review",10
Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Gold),Apple,1157,2,"____I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",270

Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Gold),Apple,1157,2,"____I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",265

I would prefer not suffering third degree burns when simply charging your device. Over 2.5 million devices have been recalled and multiple lawsuits claiming negligence on Samsung‚Äôs part has been filed for damages. So it looks like apple has a great opportunity here to win back consumers after the 6S failed to captivate the market place. The Iphone 7 is a stunning phone visually. I picked the jet black version as apple has done a nice job here with color design. Going back the design of the phone as we all know the headphone jack has been removed. I do own the apple earpods which work with this bluetooth like technology or whatever and connecting them has been a breeze and so was wearing them for an extended period of time. But still this integration is not perfect. I spent over 100 dollars on wired beats last year and now they cannot be used easily without spending even more money which I refuse to do. Also I do fear I may lose these earphones as they are quite small and can get lost within a backpack it looks like. I have no ideal how the market will react to this change but we will find out. You definitely can adapt to this major design change if you want to. All your volume buttons and power buttons appear to be in the same spot.

The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",270

Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Jet Black),Apple,1123,1,"I have been a fervent Samsung fan since the S4 but I finally got fed up with the appalling battery life on the S6 that I still have. As with all expensive phones I am careful - screen protector and case go on at the same time the phone comes out of the box. I made the jump to Apple because my family all have them and I travel abroad so much - making it easier to communicate within the iMessage environment.I have been using WhatsApp for years and thought the transition of transferring my messages from the backup would be easy. NO WAY. The only way to do it is to pay for third party software to get all your old messages transferred across. No big deal - just another $20.Then when the phone falls on the floor flat from a coffee table (about a foot tall) I paid no attention at the time. Later in the day I see that the screen is cracked! Seriously? After 2 weeks! I have dropped many of the Samsung phones over the years from higher places and awkward angles and the worst I have had is to change the screen protector. But nope this is a goner already. What happened to Cornings glass and all that good stuff? Have I bought a fake phone or is the build quality really that poor? For over $1000 I expect more but sadly I am not in the US at the moment. I am disgusted and obviously regret this purchase.**Update** Sadly the story gets worse. The crack has turned out to be water damage so even with insurance that is now another $100 to replace the phone! Water resistant does not mean water proof - well I know that but it is supposed to resist being wet in my pocket during a rain shower, right? Well apparently not. So honestly after watching videos of people sticking this phone into 1.5m of water for 30 minutes I am even more dumbfounded. Why bother labelling it water resistant at all - just keep the damn phone dry like before. One day they will have a waterproof phone - oh yes they already exist but not at Apple.",0

Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Rose Gold),Apple,1135,5,"After a long wait the Iphone 7 is now here. Thanks Samsung for messing up the note 7 launch. I would prefer not suffering third degree burns when simply charging your device. Over 2.5 million devices have been recalled and multiple lawsuits claiming negligence on Samsung‚Äôs part has been filed for damages. So it looks like apple has a great opportunity here to win back consumers after the 6S failed to captivate the market place. The Iphone 7 is a stunning phone visually. I picked the jet black version as apple has done a nice job here with color design. Going back the design of the phone as we all know the headphone jack has been removed. I do own the apple earpods which work with this bluetooth like technology or whatever and connecting them has been a breeze and so was wearing them for an extended period of time. But still this integration is not perfect. I spent over 100 dollars on wired beats last year and now they cannot be used easily without spending even more money which I refuse to do. Also I do fear I may lose these earphones as they are quite small and can get lost within a backpack it looks like. I have no ideal how the market will react to this change but we will find out. You definitely can adapt to this major design change if you want to. All your volume buttons and power buttons appear to be in the same spot. The touch ID and home button are on the front at the bottom. Both of your volume and power buttons are on the side. The back is a little different now boasting a 12mp dual camera which does in fact produce some great shots that rival the samsung galaxy s7 and edge.Here are some more details on the specsLTE Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30Non expandable storage 16GB, 64GB, 256GB5.5 Retina HD 1920x1080 displayA10 Processor, IP 67Wide Angle and Telephoto ApertureIf you are wondering about IOS 10 well it comes stock with the Iphone 7 and with good reason. They made a lot of incremental changes that adds up. Emojis and gifs now come stock with the messenger app something facebook messenger had for a bit but it‚Äôs great to see apple join the bandwagon, siri can now be used with third party apps like linkedin and yelp, sony lyrics were added to apple music/itunes even voice mail transcription is available. Like usual gaming performance on IOS 10 is great games from asphalt 8 to modern combat 5 plays very well and man oh man do these versions look better than they do on android even with nouget‚Äôs vulkan api. They still don‚Äôt look as good as they do here. Overall I think I said a line that describes this phone perfectly. They made a lot of incremental changes that adds up in end. Considering the recent blunders of samsung this phone is definitely something you should consider this holiday season. Thanks very much for reading this review",10
Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Rose Gold),Apple,1135,2,"____I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",265

Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 32 GB - US Version (Gold),Apple,914.99,1,"I have been a fervent Samsung fan since the S4 but I finally got fed up with the appalling battery life on the S6 that I still have. As with all expensive phones I am careful - screen protector and case go on at the same time the phone comes out of the box. I made the jump to Apple because my family all have them and I travel abroad so much - making it easier to communicate within the iMessage environment.I have been using WhatsApp for years and thought the transition of transferring my messages from the backup would be easy. NO WAY. The only way to do it is to pay for third party software to get all your old messages transferred across. No big deal - just another $20.Then when the phone falls on the floor flat from a coffee table (about a foot tall) I paid no attention at the time. Later in the day I see that the screen is cracked! Seriously? After 2 weeks! I have dropped many of the Samsung phones over the years from higher places and awkward angles and the worst I have had is to change the screen protector. But nope this is a goner already. What happened to Cornings glass and all that good stuff? Have I bought a fake phone or is the build quality really that poor? For over $1000 I expect more but sadly I am not in the US at the moment. I am disgusted and obviously regret this purchase.**Update** Sadly the story gets worse. The crack has turned out to be water damage so even with insurance that is now another $100 to replace the phone! Water resistant does not mean water proof - well I know that but it is supposed to resist being wet in my pocket during a rain shower, right? Well apparently not. So honestly after watching videos of people sticking this phone into 1.5m of water for 30 minutes I am even more dumbfounded. Why bother labelling it water resistant at all - just keep the damn phone dry like before. One day they will have a waterproof phone - oh yes they already exist but not at Apple.",0

Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 32 GB - US Version (Gold),Apple,914.99,5,"After a long wait the Iphone 7 is now here. Thanks Samsung for messing up the note 7 launch. I would prefer not suffering third degree burns when simply charging your device. Over 2.5 million devices have been recalled and multiple lawsuits claiming negligence on Samsung‚Äôs part has been filed for damages. So it looks like apple has a great opportunity here to win back consumers after the 6S failed to captivate the market place. The Iphone 7 is a stunning phone visually. I picked the jet black version as apple has done a nice job here with color design. Going back the design of the phone as we all know the headphone jack has been removed. I do own the apple earpods which work with this bluetooth like technology or whatever and connecting them has been a breeze and so was wearing them for an extended period of time. But still this integration is not perfect. I spent over 100 dollars on wired beats last year and now they cannot be used easily without spending even more money which I refuse to do. Also I do fear I may lose these earphones as they are quite small and can get lost within a backpack it looks like. I have no ideal how the market will react to this change but we will find out. You definitely can adapt to this major design change if you want to. All your volume buttons and power buttons appear to be in the same spot. The touch ID and home button are on the front at the bottom. Both of your volume and power buttons are on the side. The back is a little different now boasting a 12mp dual camera which does in fact produce some great shots that rival the samsung galaxy s7 and edge.Here are some more details on the specsLTE Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30Non expandable storage 16GB, 64GB, 256GB5.5 Retina HD 1920x1080 displayA10 Processor, IP 67Wide Angle and Telephoto ApertureIf you are wondering about IOS 10 well it comes stock with the Iphone 7 and with good reason. They made a lot of incremental changes that adds up. Emojis and gifs now come stock with the messenger app something facebook messenger had for a bit but it‚Äôs great to see apple join the bandwagon, siri can now be used with third party apps like linkedin and yelp, sony lyrics were added to apple music/itunes even voice mail transcription is available. Like usual gaming performance on IOS 10 is great games from asphalt 8 to modern combat 5 plays very well and man oh man do these versions look better than they do on android even with nouget‚Äôs vulkan api. They still don‚Äôt look as good as they do here. Overall I think I said a line that describes this phone perfectly. They made a lot of incremental changes that adds up in end. Considering the recent blunders of samsung this phone is definitely something you should consider this holiday season. Thanks very much for reading this review",10
Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 32 GB - US Version (Gold),Apple,914.99,2,"____I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",270

Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 32 GB - US Version (Gold),Apple,914.99,5,"After a long wait the Iphone 7 is now here. Thanks Samsung for messing up the note 7 launch. I would prefer not suffering third degree burns when simply charging your device. Over 2.5 million devices have been recalled and multiple lawsuits claiming negligence on Samsung‚Äôs part has been filed for damages. So it looks like apple has a great opportunity here to win back consumers after the 6S failed to captivate the market place. The Iphone 7 is a stunning phone visually. I picked the jet black version as apple has done a nice job here with color design. Going back the design of the phone as we all know the headphone jack has been removed. I do own the apple earpods which work with this bluetooth like technology or whatever and connecting them has been a breeze and so was wearing them for an extended period of time. But still this integration is not perfect. I spent over 100 dollars on wired beats last year and now they cannot be used easily without spending even more money which I refuse to do. Also I do fear I may lose these earphones as they are quite small and can get lost within a backpack it looks like. I have no ideal how the market will react to this change but we will find out. You definitely can adapt to this major design change if you want to. All your volume buttons and power buttons appear to be in the same spot. The touch ID and home button are on the front at the bottom. Both of your volume and power buttons are on the side. The back is a little different now boasting a 12mp dual camera which does in fact produce some great shots that rival the samsung galaxy s7 and edge.Here are some more details on the specsLTE Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30Non expandable storage 16GB, 64GB, 256GB5.5 Retina HD 1920x1080 displayA10 Processor, IP 67Wide Angle and Telephoto ApertureIf you are wondering about IOS 10 well it comes stock with the Iphone 7 and with good reason. They made a lot of incremental changes that adds up. Emojis and gifs now come stock with the messenger app something facebook messenger had for a bit but it‚Äôs great to see apple join the bandwagon, siri can now be used with third party apps like linkedin and yelp, sony lyrics were added to apple music/itunes even voice mail transcription is available. Like usual gaming performance on IOS 10 is great games from asphalt 8 to modern combat 5 plays very well and man oh man do these versions look better than they do on android even with nouget‚Äôs vulkan api. They still don‚Äôt look as good as they do here. Overall I think I said a line that describes this phone perfectly. They made a lot of incremental changes that adds up in end. Considering the recent blunders of samsung this phone is definitely something you should consider this holiday season. Thanks very much for reading this review",10
Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 32 GB - US Version (Gold),Apple,914.99,2,"____I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up.

Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 32 GB - US Version (Rose Gold),Apple,919.76,1,"I have been a fervent Samsung fan since the S4 but I finally got fed up with the appalling battery life on the S6 that I still have. As with all expensive phones I am careful - screen protector and case go on at the same time the phone comes out of the box. I made the jump to Apple because my family all have them and I travel abroad so much - making it easier to communicate within the iMessage environment.I have been using WhatsApp for years and thought the transition of transferring my messages from the backup would be easy. NO WAY. The only way to do it is to pay for third party software to get all your old messages transferred across. No big deal - just another $20.Then when the phone falls on the floor flat from a coffee table (about a foot tall) I paid no attention at the time. Later in the day I see that the screen is cracked! Seriously? After 2 weeks! I have dropped many of the Samsung phones over the years from higher places and awkward angles and the worst I have had is to change the screen protector. But nope this is a goner already. What happened to Cornings glass and all that good stuff? Have I bought a fake phone or is the build quality really that poor? For over $1000 I expect more but sadly I am not in the US at the moment. I am disgusted and obviously regret this purchase.**Update** Sadly the story gets worse. The crack has turned out to be water damage so even with insurance that is now another $100 to replace the phone! Water resistant does not mean water proof - well I know that but it is supposed to resist being wet in my pocket during a rain shower, right? Well apparently not. So honestly after watching videos of people sticking this phone into 1.5m of water for 30 minutes I am even more dumbfounded. Why bother labelling it water resistant at all - just keep the damn phone dry like before. One day they will have a waterproof phone - oh yes they already exist but not at Apple.",0

Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 32 GB - US Version (Rose Gold),Apple,919.76,5,"After a long wait the Iphone 7 is now here. Thanks Samsung for messing up the note 7 launch. I would prefer not suffering third degree burns when simply charging your device. Over 2.5 million devices have been recalled and multiple lawsuits claiming negligence on Samsung‚Äôs part has been filed for damages. So it looks like apple has a great opportunity here to win back consumers after the 6S failed to captivate the market place. The Iphone 7 is a stunning phone visually. I picked the jet black version as apple has done a nice job here with color design. Going back the design of the phone as we all know the headphone jack has been removed. I do own the apple earpods which work with this bluetooth like technology or whatever and connecting them has been a breeze and so was wearing them for an extended period of time. But still this integration is not perfect. I spent over 100 dollars on wired beats last year and now they cannot be used easily without spending even more money which I refuse to do. Also I do fear I may lose these earphones as they are quite small and can get lost within a backpack it looks like. I have no ideal how the market will react to this change but we will find out. You definitely can adapt to this major design change if you want to. All your volume buttons and power buttons appear to be in the same spot. The touch ID and home button are on the front at the bottom. Both of your volume and power buttons are on the side. The back is a little different now boasting a 12mp dual camera which does in fact produce some great shots that rival the samsung galaxy s7 and edge.Here are some more details on the specsLTE Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30Non expandable storage 16GB, 64GB, 256GB5.5 Retina HD 1920x1080 displayA10 Processor, IP 67Wide Angle and Telephoto ApertureIf you are wondering about IOS 10 well it comes stock with the Iphone 7 and with good reason. They made a lot of incremental changes that adds up. Emojis and gifs now come stock with the messenger app something facebook messenger had for a bit but it‚Äôs great to see apple join the bandwagon, siri can now be used with third party apps like linkedin and yelp, sony lyrics were added to apple music/itunes even voice mail transcription is available. Like usual gaming performance on IOS 10 is great games from asphalt 8 to modern combat 5 plays very well and man oh man do these versions look better than they do on android even with nouget‚Äôs vulkan api. They still don‚Äôt look as good as they do here. Overall I think I said a line that describes this phone perfectly. They made a lot of incremental changes that adds up in end. Considering the recent blunders of samsung this phone is definitely something you should consider this holiday season. Thanks very much for reading this review",10
Apple iPhone 7 Plus Unlocked Phone 32 GB - US Version (Rose Gold),Apple,919.76,2,"____I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",270

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 128 GB - US Version (Black),Apple,829.95,5,"If anyone is interested to know how the 7 performs compared to the 6 and 6sCamera is a little better and you notice it for sure. It is a lot better in low lights conditions.SPEED, I was using a 6s and I notice a much snappier Safari and iMessage screens. Part of it may be IOS 10 but pages pop really fast. It is way way faster than the original 6.Black looks awesome!!! But is is so slick. There are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. I saw the Glossy Jet Black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches. So most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important. Mainly if you want a white front or black.I love the new home button, took about 5 minutes to get use to and I don't miss the old home button at all.Any case with a large camera cutout like the CM4 wallet case works with the 7. But most likely all other will not. Some of mine I can cut out around the old camera hole and use it until new cases come out. But I promise you this phone is slippery when dry!!Overall I love it! Fastest device that I have ever used. I can out type the 6s sometimes on reviews but thiamine keep up no problem.128g is perfect in size for most everyone. Hardcore photo and video people may want the 256g.No headphone jack, doesn't bother me at all. The adapter sounds fine with my expensive headphones. It's not really that large either. The lightning headphones sound really good to me. I tested the same song with the same headphone using a 6s and the 7 with the adapter and I cannot tell the difference. In some ways the 7 with the adpater sounded cleaner and had a little less aliasing hiss from the analog to digital conversion process. So beside have a little while cable sticking out I think the 7 audio is fine.IPhone 4,5, 5s, SE and 6 users will feel a huge speed increase. The 6s is not far off speed wise but it is noticeable to me.No matter how you split up the payment or go with a upgrade contract price, you'll pay full price for any of the phones. It is all just creative math by the vendors. I bought mine outright and got point on my credit card, enough to reduce my price by $25.00. I also heard the Black and Jet Blacks maybe high in demand.Hope this helps :)",75

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 128 GB - US Version (Black),Apple,829.95,2,"___I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:___Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",478

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 128 GB - US Version (Gold),Apple,829.99,2,"___I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:___Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",478

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 128 GB - US Version (Gold),Apple,829.99,5,"If anyone is interested to know how the 7 performs compared to the 6 and 6sCamera is a little better and you notice it for sure. It is a lot better in low lights conditions.SPEED, I was using a 6s and I notice a much snappier Safari and iMessage screens. Part of it may be IOS 10 but pages pop really fast. It is way way faster than the original 6.Black looks awesome!!! But is is so slick. There are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. I saw the Glossy Jet Black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches. So most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important. Mainly if you want a white front or black.I love the new home button, took about 5 minutes to get use to and I don't miss the old home button at all.Any case with a large camera cutout like the CM4 wallet case works with the 7. But most likely all other will not. Some of mine I can cut out around the old camera hole and use it until new cases come out. But I promise you this phone is slippery when dry!!Overall I love it! Fastest device that I have ever used. I can out type the 6s sometimes on reviews but thiamine keep up no problem.128g is perfect in size for most everyone. Hardcore photo and video people may want the 256g.No headphone jack, doesn't bother me at all. The adapter sounds fine with my expensive headphones. It's not really that large either. The lightning headphones sound really good to me. I tested the same song with the same headphone using a 6s and the 7 with the adapter and I cannot tell the difference. In some ways the 7 with the adpater sounded cleaner and had a little less aliasing hiss from the analog to digital conversion process. So beside have a little while cable sticking out I think the 7 audio is fine.IPhone 4,5, 5s, SE and 6 users will feel a huge speed increase. The 6s is not far off speed wise but it is noticeable to me.No matter how you split up the payment or go with a upgrade contract price, you'll pay full price for any of the phones. It is all just creative math by the vendors. I bought mine outright and got point on my credit card, enough to reduce my price by $25.00. I also heard the Black and Jet Blacks maybe high in demand.Hope this helps :)",72

The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",462

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 128 GB - US Version (Rose Gold),Apple,824.95,5,"If anyone is interested to know how the 7 performs compared to the 6 and 6sCamera is a little better and you notice it for sure. It is a lot better in low lights conditions.SPEED, I was using a 6s and I notice a much snappier Safari and iMessage screens. Part of it may be IOS 10 but pages pop really fast. It is way way faster than the original 6.Black looks awesome!!! But is is so slick. There are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. I saw the Glossy Jet Black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches. So most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important. Mainly if you want a white front or black.I love the new home button, took about 5 minutes to get use to and I don't miss the old home button at all.Any case with a large camera cutout like the CM4 wallet case works with the 7. But most likely all other will not. Some of mine I can cut out around the old camera hole and use it until new cases come out. But I promise you this phone is slippery when dry!!Overall I love it! Fastest device that I have ever used. I can out type the 6s sometimes on reviews but thiamine keep up no problem.128g is perfect in size for most everyone. Hardcore photo and video people may want the 256g.No headphone jack, doesn't bother me at all. The adapter sounds fine with my expensive headphones. It's not really that large either. The lightning headphones sound really good to me. I tested the same song with the same headphone using a 6s and the 7 with the adapter and I cannot tell the difference. In some ways the 7 with the adpater sounded cleaner and had a little less aliasing hiss from the analog to digital conversion process. So beside have a little while cable sticking out I think the 7 audio is fine.IPhone 4,5, 5s, SE and 6 users will feel a huge speed increase. The 6s is not far off speed wise but it is noticeable to me.No matter how you split up the payment or go with a upgrade contract price, you'll pay full price for any of the phones. It is all just creative math by the vendors. I bought mine outright and got point on my credit card, enough to reduce my price by $25.00. I also heard the Black and Jet Blacks maybe high in demand.Hope this helps :)",75

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 128 GB - US Version (Rose Gold),Apple,824.95,2,"___I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:___Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",478

My guess is that apple suspended this phone as a means of theft protection as it was originally from Canada and I am in the states but bottom line is please fix this issue. Very disappointed and don't know what to say. I paid 990 for nothing. Please do not buy unless you plan to use prepaid sim.,3

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 128 GB - US Version (Silver),Apple,848,5,"If anyone is interested to know how the 7 performs compared to the 6 and 6sCamera is a little better and you notice it for sure. It is a lot better in low lights conditions.SPEED, I was using a 6s and I notice a much snappier Safari and iMessage screens. Part of it may be IOS 10 but pages pop really fast. It is way way faster than the original 6.Black looks awesome!!! But is is so slick. There are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. I saw the Glossy Jet Black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches. So most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important. Mainly if you want a white front or black.I love the new home button, took about 5 minutes to get use to and I don't miss the old home button at all.Any case with a large camera cutout like the CM4 wallet case works with the 7. But most likely all other will not. Some of mine I can cut out around the old camera hole and use it until new cases come out. But I promise you this phone is slippery when dry!!Overall I love it! Fastest device that I have ever used. I can out type the 6s sometimes on reviews but thiamine keep up no problem.128g is perfect in size for most everyone. Hardcore photo and video people may want the 256g.No headphone jack, doesn't bother me at all. The adapter sounds fine with my expensive headphones. It's not really that large either. The lightning headphones sound really good to me. I tested the same song with the same headphone using a 6s and the 7 with the adapter and I cannot tell the difference. In some ways the 7 with the adpater sounded cleaner and had a little less aliasing hiss from the analog to digital conversion process. So beside have a little while cable sticking out I think the 7 audio is fine.IPhone 4,5, 5s, SE and 6 users will feel a huge speed increase. The 6s is not far off speed wise but it is noticeable to me.No matter how you split up the payment or go with a upgrade contract price, you'll pay full price for any of the phones. It is all just creative math by the vendors. I bought mine outright and got point on my credit card, enough to reduce my price by $25.00. I also heard the Black and Jet Blacks maybe high in demand.Hope this helps :)",75

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 128 GB - US Version (Silver),Apple,848,2,"___I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:___Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",478

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Black),Apple,922,2,"___I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:___Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences.

With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products.

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Black),Apple,922,5,"If anyone is interested to know how the 7 performs compared to the 6 and 6sCamera is a little better and you notice it for sure. It is a lot better in low lights conditions.SPEED, I was using a 6s and I notice a much snappier Safari and iMessage screens. Part of it may be IOS 10 but pages pop really fast. It is way way faster than the original 6.Black looks awesome!!! But is is so slick. There are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. I saw the Glossy Jet Black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches. So most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important. Mainly if you want a white front or black.I love the new home button, took about 5 minutes to get use to and I don't miss the old home button at all.Any case with a large camera cutout like the CM4 wallet case works with the 7. But most likely all other will not. Some of mine I can cut out around the old camera hole and use it until new cases come out. But I promise you this phone is slippery when dry!!Overall I love it! Fastest device that I have ever used. I can out type the 6s sometimes on reviews but thiamine keep up no problem.128g is perfect in size for most everyone. Hardcore photo and video people may want the 256g.No headphone jack, doesn't bother me at all. The adapter sounds fine with my expensive headphones. It's not really that large either. The lightning headphones sound really good to me. I tested the same song with the same headphone using a 6s and the 7 with the adapter and I cannot tell the difference. In some ways the 7 with the adpater sounded cleaner and had a little less aliasing hiss from the analog to digital conversion process. So beside have a little while cable sticking out I think the 7 audio is fine.IPhone 4,5, 5s, SE and 6 users will feel a huge speed increase. The 6s is not far off speed wise but it is noticeable to me.No matter how you split up the payment or go with a upgrade contract price, you'll pay full price for any of the phones. It is all just creative math by the vendors. I bought mine outright and got point on my credit card, enough to reduce my price by $25.00. I also heard the Black and Jet Blacks maybe high in demand.Hope this helps :)",73

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Black),Apple,922,2,"___I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:___Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",465

The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",478

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Gold),Apple,889.99,5,"If anyone is interested to know how the 7 performs compared to the 6 and 6sCamera is a little better and you notice it for sure. It is a lot better in low lights conditions.SPEED, I was using a 6s and I notice a much snappier Safari and iMessage screens. Part of it may be IOS 10 but pages pop really fast. It is way way faster than the original 6.Black looks awesome!!! But is is so slick. There are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. I saw the Glossy Jet Black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches. So most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important. Mainly if you want a white front or black.I love the new home button, took about 5 minutes to get use to and I don't miss the old home button at all.Any case with a large camera cutout like the CM4 wallet case works with the 7. But most likely all other will not. Some of mine I can cut out around the old camera hole and use it until new cases come out. But I promise you this phone is slippery when dry!!Overall I love it! Fastest device that I have ever used. I can out type the 6s sometimes on reviews but thiamine keep up no problem.128g is perfect in size for most everyone. Hardcore photo and video people may want the 256g.No headphone jack, doesn't bother me at all. The adapter sounds fine with my expensive headphones. It's not really that large either. The lightning headphones sound really good to me. I tested the same song with the same headphone using a 6s and the 7 with the adapter and I cannot tell the difference. In some ways the 7 with the adpater sounded cleaner and had a little less aliasing hiss from the analog to digital conversion process. So beside have a little while cable sticking out I think the 7 audio is fine.IPhone 4,5, 5s, SE and 6 users will feel a huge speed increase. The 6s is not far off speed wise but it is noticeable to me.No matter how you split up the payment or go with a upgrade contract price, you'll pay full price for any of the phones. It is all just creative math by the vendors. I bought mine outright and got point on my credit card, enough to reduce my price by $25.00. I also heard the Black and Jet Blacks maybe high in demand.Hope this helps :)",73

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Gold),Apple,889.99,2,"___I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:___Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones.

Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",465

It looked like it was purchased at Best Buy, ""sim free"". I could not activate it with an international SIM Card. Luckily I found someone with a US Verizon SIM card to install durning the activation process. Once it was activated with the Verizon card I was able to install my international Sim Card and everything worked.If you are looking to purchase one of these phones internationally make sure you have a US sim card to go through the activation process, or research the US Reseller Flex Policy.",120

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Jet Black),Apple,949.95,2,"___I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:___Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",478

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Jet Black),Apple,949.95,5,"If anyone is interested to know how the 7 performs compared to the 6 and 6sCamera is a little better and you notice it for sure. It is a lot better in low lights conditions.SPEED, I was using a 6s and I notice a much snappier Safari and iMessage screens. Part of it may be IOS 10 but pages pop really fast. It is way way faster than the original 6.Black looks awesome!!! But is is so slick. There are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. I saw the Glossy Jet Black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches. So most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important. Mainly if you want a white front or black.I love the new home button, took about 5 minutes to get use to and I don't miss the old home button at all.Any case with a large camera cutout like the CM4 wallet case works with the 7. But most likely all other will not. Some of mine I can cut out around the old camera hole and use it until new cases come out. But I promise you this phone is slippery when dry!!Overall I love it! Fastest device that I have ever used. I can out type the 6s sometimes on reviews but thiamine keep up no problem.128g is perfect in size for most everyone. Hardcore photo and video people may want the 256g.No headphone jack, doesn't bother me at all. The adapter sounds fine with my expensive headphones. It's not really that large either. The lightning headphones sound really good to me. I tested the same song with the same headphone using a 6s and the 7 with the adapter and I cannot tell the difference. In some ways the 7 with the adpater sounded cleaner and had a little less aliasing hiss from the analog to digital conversion process. So beside have a little while cable sticking out I think the 7 audio is fine.IPhone 4,5, 5s, SE and 6 users will feel a huge speed increase. The 6s is not far off speed wise but it is noticeable to me.No matter how you split up the payment or go with a upgrade contract price, you'll pay full price for any of the phones. It is all just creative math by the vendors. I bought mine outright and got point on my credit card, enough to reduce my price by $25.00. I also heard the Black and Jet Blacks maybe high in demand.Hope this helps :)",73

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Jet Black),Apple,949.95,2,"___I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:___Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",465

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Rose Gold),Apple,908.99,2,"___I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:___Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage.

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Silver),Apple,919.95,2,"___I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:___Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences.

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Silver),Apple,919.95,5,"If anyone is interested to know how the 7 performs compared to the 6 and 6sCamera is a little better and you notice it for sure. It is a lot better in low lights conditions.SPEED, I was using a 6s and I notice a much snappier Safari and iMessage screens. Part of it may be IOS 10 but pages pop really fast. It is way way faster than the original 6.Black looks awesome!!! But is is so slick. There are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. I saw the Glossy Jet Black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches. So most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important. Mainly if you want a white front or black.I love the new home button, took about 5 minutes to get use to and I don't miss the old home button at all.Any case with a large camera cutout like the CM4 wallet case works with the 7. But most likely all other will not. Some of mine I can cut out around the old camera hole and use it until new cases come out. But I promise you this phone is slippery when dry!!Overall I love it! Fastest device that I have ever used. I can out type the 6s sometimes on reviews but thiamine keep up no problem.128g is perfect in size for most everyone. Hardcore photo and video people may want the 256g.No headphone jack, doesn't bother me at all. The adapter sounds fine with my expensive headphones. It's not really that large either. The lightning headphones sound really good to me. I tested the same song with the same headphone using a 6s and the 7 with the adapter and I cannot tell the difference. In some ways the 7 with the adpater sounded cleaner and had a little less aliasing hiss from the analog to digital conversion process. So beside have a little while cable sticking out I think the 7 audio is fine.IPhone 4,5, 5s, SE and 6 users will feel a huge speed increase. The 6s is not far off speed wise but it is noticeable to me.No matter how you split up the payment or go with a upgrade contract price, you'll pay full price for any of the phones. It is all just creative math by the vendors. I bought mine outright and got point on my credit card, enough to reduce my price by $25.00. I also heard the Black and Jet Blacks maybe high in demand.Hope this helps :)",73

With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",465

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 32 GB - US Version (Black),Apple,714.65,2,"___I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:___Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones.

Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",478

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 32 GB - US Version (Black),Apple,714.65,5,"If anyone is interested to know how the 7 performs compared to the 6 and 6sCamera is a little better and you notice it for sure. It is a lot better in low lights conditions.SPEED, I was using a 6s and I notice a much snappier Safari and iMessage screens. Part of it may be IOS 10 but pages pop really fast. It is way way faster than the original 6.Black looks awesome!!! But is is so slick. There are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. I saw the Glossy Jet Black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches. So most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important. Mainly if you want a white front or black.I love the new home button, took about 5 minutes to get use to and I don't miss the old home button at all.Any case with a large camera cutout like the CM4 wallet case works with the 7. But most likely all other will not. Some of mine I can cut out around the old camera hole and use it until new cases come out. But I promise you this phone is slippery when dry!!Overall I love it! Fastest device that I have ever used. I can out type the 6s sometimes on reviews but thiamine keep up no problem.128g is perfect in size for most everyone. Hardcore photo and video people may want the 256g.No headphone jack, doesn't bother me at all. The adapter sounds fine with my expensive headphones. It's not really that large either. The lightning headphones sound really good to me. I tested the same song with the same headphone using a 6s and the 7 with the adapter and I cannot tell the difference. In some ways the 7 with the adpater sounded cleaner and had a little less aliasing hiss from the analog to digital conversion process. So beside have a little while cable sticking out I think the 7 audio is fine.IPhone 4,5, 5s, SE and 6 users will feel a huge speed increase. The 6s is not far off speed wise but it is noticeable to me.No matter how you split up the payment or go with a upgrade contract price, you'll pay full price for any of the phones. It is all just creative math by the vendors. I bought mine outright and got point on my credit card, enough to reduce my price by $25.00. I also heard the Black and Jet Blacks maybe high in demand.Hope this helps :)",75

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 32 GB - US Version (Gold),Apple,698.95,2,"___I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:___Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",478

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 32 GB - US Version (Gold),Apple,698.95,5,"If anyone is interested to know how the 7 performs compared to the 6 and 6sCamera is a little better and you notice it for sure. It is a lot better in low lights conditions.SPEED, I was using a 6s and I notice a much snappier Safari and iMessage screens. Part of it may be IOS 10 but pages pop really fast. It is way way faster than the original 6.Black looks awesome!!! But is is so slick. There are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. I saw the Glossy Jet Black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches. So most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important. Mainly if you want a white front or black.I love the new home button, took about 5 minutes to get use to and I don't miss the old home button at all.Any case with a large camera cutout like the CM4 wallet case works with the 7. But most likely all other will not. Some of mine I can cut out around the old camera hole and use it until new cases come out. But I promise you this phone is slippery when dry!!Overall I love it! Fastest device that I have ever used. I can out type the 6s sometimes on reviews but thiamine keep up no problem.128g is perfect in size for most everyone. Hardcore photo and video people may want the 256g.No headphone jack, doesn't bother me at all. The adapter sounds fine with my expensive headphones. It's not really that large either. The lightning headphones sound really good to me. I tested the same song with the same headphone using a 6s and the 7 with the adapter and I cannot tell the difference. In some ways the 7 with the adpater sounded cleaner and had a little less aliasing hiss from the analog to digital conversion process. So beside have a little while cable sticking out I think the 7 audio is fine.IPhone 4,5, 5s, SE and 6 users will feel a huge speed increase. The 6s is not far off speed wise but it is noticeable to me.No matter how you split up the payment or go with a upgrade contract price, you'll pay full price for any of the phones. It is all just creative math by the vendors. I bought mine outright and got point on my credit card, enough to reduce my price by $25.00. I also heard the Black and Jet Blacks maybe high in demand.Hope this helps :)",75

It is a lot better in low lights conditions.SPEED, I was using a 6s and I notice a much snappier Safari and iMessage screens. Part of it may be IOS 10 but pages pop really fast. It is way way faster than the original 6.Black looks awesome!!! But is is so slick. There are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. I saw the Glossy Jet Black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches. So most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important. Mainly if you want a white front or black.I love the new home button, took about 5 minutes to get use to and I don't miss the old home button at all.Any case with a large camera cutout like the CM4 wallet case works with the 7.

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 32 GB - US Version (Silver),Apple,698.45,2,"___I have owned every iPhone since the 3G model. Every year for 7 years I have upgraded. In my household is a slew of Apple products from iPad‚Äôs, MacBook‚Äôs to iPhones. My household now has 3 new iPhone 7 models. But I am also a bigtime Android owner with several high end Android phones and tablets from various manufactures. The thing is, my family loves high end tech and appreciates quality regardless of brand, make or model.I follow the mobile tech world religiously and stay abreast of all new technologies and products from all companies, big and small. I watched the Keynote on September 7th live and listened to Apple pitch the iPhone 7. I pre-ordered the 7 at 3am EST on the 9th so I could have it in my hands on the 16th.But then I came to a realization about the 7 and 7 Plus that struck a chord with me. All the new tech on the 7 is not new at all, in fact has been on several phones in some cases since 2011. I also realized that the tech inside the 7 only matches mid-range android versions. If you take the Apple logo off the back and re-brand this under Android, it would not be a $770-$970 device but a $350-$550 device given the hardware and features it has. In fact, Apples net cost on the 256GB 7 Plus is only $226 yet retails for $970. This is disturbing to me, not just the 403% profit margin, but the whole effort into making an average iPhone for today‚Äôs standards. Apple use to be a leading-edge company with innovations that took the industry by storm. Today, in 2016, Apple no longer excites me. Sure the integration between software and hardware is not matched by any tech company today but the gap is rapidly bridging. At such a premium price, I think after this version, considering there is nothing innovative about it and retails for double what other companies offer, has me moving away from Apple in 2017. I don‚Äôt know about you, but the old saying goes the bigger you are the harder you fall. Bye bye Apple, time for a divorce.___Update 9/22/2016: In response to criticism about my review:___Apple certainly raised the bar on smartphones and has kept that bar up. My expectations are high for the iPhone and as such when they are not met, as with the iPhone 7/7 Plus, my letdown is all that much harder. The IPhone 7/7 Plus are great phones do doubt, but do I think they are $970 great? Certainly not. Apple (could have) done so much better with the iPhone 7 and didn't. That is my letdown.When it comes to raw processing power Apple wins in controlled and application tests. But in 2016/17 nearly all phones are fast enough, heck even the iPhone 5s of 4 years ago is fast enough, but today, shaving milliseconds off app switching times or load times goes beyond the human brains capacity to keep up. It's not about pure brawns, ecosystems, cultures, or social image, it's about value and making life's tasks easier.Apples multi-million dollar 12 step polishing process to get the Jet black phone to shine is not nearly as important as making it available at affordable prices and offering cutting edge features that make my whole reason for existing plausible.If I walked into my Honda dealer and saw the new 2017 Accord had a price tag of $110,000 I would walk out immediately, it's about value. Even if the Accord blew the doors off its competition I still walk because its value is lost.Truth of the matter is even India's $4 phone gets the job done, and that's a fact.Lets examine the iPhone 7/7 Plus components.CPU:The A10 Fusion chip in the Apple 7‚Äôs is manufactured by TSMC, (Samsung made the A9 chips in the 6s). It is a quad-core 16nm big.LITTLE soC running at 2.34GHz tops, 1.3GHz nominal with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM, (2GB on the 4.7- inch version). Similar chips and even more powerful quad-core, hexi-core and even octa-core chips run in various far less expensive phones using 4GB to 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM running in dual channel mode. The one thing Apple does do extremely well is manage its RAM which is all software based. The Linux driven Android software has not got there yet. Yes, this is an advantage Apple currently holds over the competition but one that is vastly slipping away.LCD:The LCD panel is also on level with submarket phones. The LPIPS 1080 panel is rated at 401P, 1300:1 contrast, (1400:1 on the 4.7 inch), 625nits and P3 Cinematic color gamut at 125%. Let‚Äôs examine this. With the exception of the P3 color gamut, every $200 and above phone has this or better. I can list a slew of phones all under $300 that have LPIPS, (or even better OLED), 1080 FHD, 1500:1 to infinite contrast ratio, 500-700nits and sRGB color gamut at 100%. The Neo-LPIPS panel supplied on Huawei products is nearly as excellent as the S-AMOLEDS produced by Samsung and supplied on phones starting at $150. Apple has been in talks with Samsung about supplying s-AMOLED panels for the iPhone for 3 years, I believe the iPhone 8 will receive this panel next year. The cinematic P3 rating and higher brightness output (nit) was given to the iPhone 7‚Äôs to help make the photos pop on-screen better.CAMERA:The Bokeh effects of the dual camera system on the 7 Plus can easily be duplicated in Post with software. I won‚Äôt argue and say the camera implementation on the iPhone 7‚Äôs is not excellent, sure it is. But the Leica dual camera system on the P9 and Honor 8 are just as good and offered on devices that match or surpass other technical features and cost half as much. The camera system on the S7 is excellent too. LG has excellent implementations on the older G4, G5 and new V20. The LG G4 that can be had for $150, has a 2.1GHz hexi-core CPU, 3GB RAM, 5.5-ich QHD screen, 32GB on board memory, 128GB SD slot, and a 16MP camera that shoots in RAW and even by today‚Äôs standards is excellent shooter.SOFTWARE:With iOS 10 we can now delete stock Apple apps. This is Apples way of saying they understand their app versions suck and no one uses them or want them. We can replace them with much better 3rd party versions that also happen to have equally good Android versions. In the 30 days iOS 10 has been on the iPhone 7, (9/16 to 10/12), it has had two major updates, v10.0.1 and v10.0.2. Let‚Äôs not forget the epic failure of the lightening headphones, Gallery App and extensions crashing. This is a bug fix every two weeks. Also in the 30 days I have owned my iPhone 7 I have had to perform two hard resets for Apple Apps locking and seizing up, one was Safari the other iMessages. At one point I had to get Apple support on the phone. In 2016/2017 Android v7.01 (and 6.0.1) are just as stable and efficient and maybe even more so, but my point is there is no advantage one over the other, at this stage it is simply a matter of personal preferences. We can‚Äôt argue that iOS is superior to Android because surely is not. With almost all apps being cross-platform functional communications between iOS and Android is now transparent and we can fully immerse in both worlds without any effects.SAMSUNG:I have given the same review about Samsung products. Samsung is by no means the Messiah of Android. Their products are matched or outdone with less expensive variants as well. Samsung will have a very difficult time recovering from their $1B fiasco this year. When a company starts selling of its stock interest and shares on partner companies and liquidating core assets you know they are in trouble.STORAGE:The reason Apple does not offer external SD storage is twofold. One, the SD license is held by Microsoft and Apple would have to pay royalties to Microsoft in order to use it. Apple will never pay royalties to any company ‚Äì royalties are paid to Apple not the other way around. Two, Apple would lose control over file sharing.APPLE TRIVIA - DID YOU KNOW:Did you know the iPhone has many Samsung components? Samsung has made the CPU/GPU for several generations of iPhones. This year with the 7 Samsung supplies the RAM chips and ROM chips. Samsung is rumored to supply its s-AMOLED screens next year for the iPhone 8.Did you know Google pays Apple $100 million/year to have Google set as the default search for Safari? Google also pays Apple a percentage for every click too.Did you know Google invests more money and R&D for its iOS apps over its own Android counterparts? Apps like Hangouts, Google Maps, Chrome, Google Now etc., get updates and new releases before its own native Android versions.Did you know that Amazon hosts the iCloud storage for Apple? Amazon is the largest cloud host in the world providing several companies with its AWS servers. Apple pays Amazon hundreds of millions of dollars every year for its cloud servers.Did you know Apple refused to pay Corning its royalties to use the Gorilla Glass name so calls its glass ‚ÄòIonized strengthened‚Äô even though it is Corning Gorilla glass version 4.Did you know the iPhone 6/6s also has water resistant features? Apple never published or made public this feature for liability reasons but the 6/6s has resins and glues inside to protect vital components from water damage. If you have ever dropped your 6/6s in water usually within a couple hours its up and running at 100%.___Thank you for reading___",478

There were no visible scratches or dents. The packaging was secure.The charger and the lightning cable were not OEM products. I did not use them as I usually prefer to trust Apple made charger. I don't not mind using non-OEM lightning cables. But I have had experience of non-OEM chargers going bad.I bought mine for $380. Given the fact that at the Apple Store a new one cost $450, a $70 savings is not bad. It was a better deal than anything on eBay. I did have to wait over a week to get it though. I think it was because the seller still has to get the phone from somewhere before turning it over to me. It came on the date of the expected delivery.",0

Apple iPhone SE Unlocked Phone - 64 GB Retail Packaging - Gold,Apple,500,5,"This iPhone gives me nostalgia, but not because of it's ""retro"" design remembering the 5s. It feels nostalgic because 10 years ago I used to carry similar sized digital cameras to capture my life in photos.When smartphones became more powerful with better cameras I still waited because they still lagged in a few things and getting a small point and shoot was still a much better value for money.The SE makes the iPhone devices 'more affordable' and it is the smartphone that has finally convinced me to ""upgrade"" my portable photography philosophy to use it as my only camera for everything. The pictures are clear, beautiful, they are much better in low light than with point and shoot cameras, the camera app is super easy, and the shutter is fast fast fast. That was I was looking for.Speaking about software, wow what can I say that hasn't been told already? iOS is very fluid and minimalist, with no bloatware, something I appreciate A LOT. With Android, even with high end devices, you still feel some hicups and lag from time to time, but iOS is the king of ""smoothness"". I've even seen 5 years old iPhone devices working still like the first time.I don't care about the screen being smaller than other smartphones nowadays, because I don't watch much video on my phones, I'm minimalist so I just keep a few apps for messaging and photos and that's it.The battery life is great, but charging takes like 1.5 hours.Typing is something that will take me a few more days to get used to, coming from a 5 inches screen, but it is something I can live with.",14

A beautiful, operating phone...When I opened the brown shipping box, I was surprised they didn't pad the inside more, but everything was in great shape. The white iPhone box was still sealed, but the phone's protective film had some scratching on it, so I'm not sure what that was about. Not an issue at all, since I was removing that anyway.The only thing that would've made the experience better would be faster shipping, but beggars can't be choosers!",0

Apple iPhone SE Unlocked Phone - 64 GB Retail Packaging - Gold,Apple,500,5,"There were some scratches on the back but it's not noticeable unless you are looking for them, it works amazing it's very fast and I'm quite satisfied. Some people like bigger phones before buying it I read reviews and such and a lot of people were saying it was very small but it really is a normal size it's just that the iPhone 6 and up are large. So if you prefer larger phones I'd suggest the iPhone 6, this phone otherwise is very similar performance rise with the iPhone 6s it just does not have 3D Touch which I don't care for, it's also around $200 cheaper than a iPhone 6s. So just some things to think about (: I love the design of it also it seems very elegant and I'm overall very happy with my SE",3

I am in Jamaica so I ordered it unlocked but was a bit skeptical as to whether it could really work in my country. It did! I'm so happy!! The packaging was beautiful! It's my second time buying a phone on Amazon & I've never been disappointed. I'm switching from a Samsung s4 mini which I bought on Amazon few years ago & I must say that was a great phone too. It fell so many times but still worked beautifully. I'm hoping that this new phone can withstand the falls just as well...I've digressed but that's my tidbit...,6

Apple iPhone SE Unlocked Phone - 64 GB Retail Packaging - Gold,Apple,500,4,"long time not use a iphone. as the high price until this one.phone is good,faster than 5s.i tried the game modern combate 5 on iphone se and my samsung galaxy S7,load the game and load the mission,iphone se made them faster than s7 about 3 secs.and the fingerprint unlock is almost the same,please note that if you use the iphone se oftenly,it unlocks the screen very fast,if you don't it will take 1-2secs more to get it done.and the only thing i don't like is upside of the screen is yellow,just a little than the other parte of the screen.it is a hardware issue,maybe apple using the screens of 5s to their iphone se.those screen are new but born 2 years ago.so i gave it 4 stars for this issue,not a big deal but you can tell.hope this would help you!",3
Apple iPhone SE Unlocked Phone - 64 GB Retail Packaging - Gold,Apple,500,5,"Since so far I am the only reviewer with an iPhone SE, I see it as my duty to present this iPhone to you. Yes, I do have this phone (sorry I have in Rose Gold, but workmanship is the same) and I am writing a real review (pictures provided!).Okay, there has been a hype for about a few months now, and the new 4"" iPhone is finally here. Some important points to take note of are that this phone has the exact same body as the iPhone 5 and 5s. Literally the exact same. Unlike the 6s that was slightly larger than the iPhone 6, this iPhone will fit each and every case and screen protector made for the iPhone 5 and 5s. Really the only difference is that this phone comes with matte edges instead of chrome, and the legal labels on the back are removed.The next point was that this phone is better than the iPhone 6 (and much cheaper). Don't let the 4"" screen fool you, this iPhone's stats are mostly on par or better than the iPhone 6 (and no, bigger screen is not better). Take the resolution. 326 ppi, same as iPhone 6. A9 chip, better and faster than the A8 in the iPhone 6. If pictures are your thing, there is a 12-megapixel iSight camera, better than the one in the iPhone 6. Don't forget Improved noise reduction, also better than the iPhone 6. Don't forget the panorama that features up to 63 megapixels, you guessed it, better than the iPhone 6's 43 megapixels. Oh, and I almost forgot (not really), 4K video is a blast. For selfies, the iPhone SE now features Retina flash, or flash from the screen. Battery life: the iPhone SE has the best battery life of all iPhone for sale today in terms of internet use time.So should you upgrade? I will start with those without a contract. If you hold any iPhone with a 4"" screen or smaller, and you are free from any contracts, then yes you should upgrade. This includes current users of iPhone 1/3G/3GS/4/4S/5/5c/5s. Here's why. If you are without a contract, you probably paid more for your current phone than you will for this one. Given that you were able to afford a full price iPhone, you can definitely enjoy the features of this phone. The way I see it, this phone is the perfect way to enjoy an iPhone 6s without the huge cost (and the 3D touch).iPhone 6 users, this one is a 50/50 call. You really should be happy with your phone, but, then again, I pretty much just trashed your phone in the specs throw down above. This one is a tough call, and one you and your wallet should decide.Those with a contract, if your contract is almost over, rejoice, you can get this phone for free. But, since you are shopping on Amazon for this phone, I assume you are not in a contract. However, if you are still in a contract for a while, it is up to you to decide if this phone is worth breaking your contract over.I hope you enjoyed reading this review more than I enjoyed writing it. If you have any questions, my email is on my profile page, and you should feel free to contact me. I, however, am not a representative from Apple, and you might just get better answers there. Who knows?",15

I was sent the wrong phone, the charger was European and it was set up before with someone's iCloud info on it. I paid for overnight on 4/20 and finally got it 5/4.

Apple iPhone SE Unlocked Phone - 64 GB Retail Packaging - Gold,Apple,500,5,Only bought this new phone as an upgrade to my Iphone 4.,0
Apple iPhone SE Unlocked Phone - 64 GB Retail Packaging - Gold,Apple,500,5,"This iPhone gives me nostalgia, but not because of it's ""retro"" design remembering the 5s. It feels nostalgic because 10 years ago I used to carry similar sized digital cameras to capture my life in photos.When smartphones became more powerful with better cameras I still waited because they still lagged in a few things and getting a small point and shoot was still a much better value for money.The SE makes the iPhone devices 'more affordable' and it is the smartphone that has finally convinced me to ""upgrade"" my portable photography philosophy to use it as my only camera for everything. The pictures are clear, beautiful, they are much better in low light than with point and shoot cameras, the camera app is super easy, and the shutter is fast fast fast. That was I was looking for.Speaking about software, wow what can I say that hasn't been told already? iOS is very fluid and minimalist, with no bloatware, something I appreciate A LOT. With Android, even with high end devices, you still feel some hicups and lag from time to time, but iOS is the king of ""smoothness"". I've even seen 5 years old iPhone devices working still like the first time.I don't care about the screen being smaller than other smartphones nowadays, because I don't watch much video on my phones, I'm minimalist so I just keep a few apps for messaging and photos and that's it.The battery life is great, but charging takes like 1.5 hours.Typing is something that will take me a few more days to get used to, coming from a 5 inches screen, but it is something I can live with.",14

Apple iPhone SE Unlocked Phone - 64 GB Retail Packaging - Rose Gold,Apple,505.99,5,"There were some scratches on the back but it's not noticeable unless you are looking for them, it works amazing it's very fast and I'm quite satisfied. Some people like bigger phones before buying it I read reviews and such and a lot of people were saying it was very small but it really is a normal size it's just that the iPhone 6 and up are large. So if you prefer larger phones I'd suggest the iPhone 6, this phone otherwise is very similar performance rise with the iPhone 6s it just does not have 3D Touch which I don't care for, it's also around $200 cheaper than a iPhone 6s. So just some things to think about (: I love the design of it also it seems very elegant and I'm overall very happy with my SE",3

Apple iPhone SE Unlocked Phone - 64 GB Retail Packaging - Rose Gold,Apple,505.99,5,"Since so far I am the only reviewer with an iPhone SE, I see it as my duty to present this iPhone to you. Yes, I do have this phone (sorry I have in Rose Gold, but workmanship is the same) and I am writing a real review (pictures provided!).Okay, there has been a hype for about a few months now, and the new 4"" iPhone is finally here. Some important points to take note of are that this phone has the exact same body as the iPhone 5 and 5s. Literally the exact same. Unlike the 6s that was slightly larger than the iPhone 6, this iPhone will fit each and every case and screen protector made for the iPhone 5 and 5s. Really the only difference is that this phone comes with matte edges instead of chrome, and the legal labels on the back are removed.The next point was that this phone is better than the iPhone 6 (and much cheaper). Don't let the 4"" screen fool you, this iPhone's stats are mostly on par or better than the iPhone 6 (and no, bigger screen is not better). Take the resolution. 326 ppi, same as iPhone 6. A9 chip, better and faster than the A8 in the iPhone 6. If pictures are your thing, there is a 12-megapixel iSight camera, better than the one in the iPhone 6. Don't forget Improved noise reduction, also better than the iPhone 6. Don't forget the panorama that features up to 63 megapixels, you guessed it, better than the iPhone 6's 43 megapixels. Oh, and I almost forgot (not really), 4K video is a blast. For selfies, the iPhone SE now features Retina flash, or flash from the screen. Battery life: the iPhone SE has the best battery life of all iPhone for sale today in terms of internet use time.So should you upgrade? I will start with those without a contract. If you hold any iPhone with a 4"" screen or smaller, and you are free from any contracts, then yes you should upgrade. This includes current users of iPhone 1/3G/3GS/4/4S/5/5c/5s. Here's why. If you are without a contract, you probably paid more for your current phone than you will for this one. Given that you were able to afford a full price iPhone, you can definitely enjoy the features of this phone. The way I see it, this phone is the perfect way to enjoy an iPhone 6s without the huge cost (and the 3D touch).iPhone 6 users, this one is a 50/50 call. You really should be happy with your phone, but, then again, I pretty much just trashed your phone in the specs throw down above. This one is a tough call, and one you and your wallet should decide.Those with a contract, if your contract is almost over, rejoice, you can get this phone for free. But, since you are shopping on Amazon for this phone, I assume you are not in a contract. However, if you are still in a contract for a while, it is up to you to decide if this phone is worth breaking your contract over.I hope you enjoyed reading this review more than I enjoyed writing it. If you have any questions, my email is on my profile page, and you should feel free to contact me. I, however, am not a representative from Apple, and you might just get better answers there. Who knows?",16

Apple iPhone SE Unlocked Phone - 64 GB Retail Packaging - Rose Gold,Apple,505.99,5,"This iPhone gives me nostalgia, but not because of it's ""retro"" design remembering the 5s. It feels nostalgic because 10 years ago I used to carry similar sized digital cameras to capture my life in photos.When smartphones became more powerful with better cameras I still waited because they still lagged in a few things and getting a small point and shoot was still a much better value for money.The SE makes the iPhone devices 'more affordable' and it is the smartphone that has finally convinced me to ""upgrade"" my portable photography philosophy to use it as my only camera for everything. The pictures are clear, beautiful, they are much better in low light than with point and shoot cameras, the camera app is super easy, and the shutter is fast fast fast. That was I was looking for.Speaking about software, wow what can I say that hasn't been told already? iOS is very fluid and minimalist, with no bloatware, something I appreciate A LOT. With Android, even with high end devices, you still feel some hicups and lag from time to time, but iOS is the king of ""smoothness"". I've even seen 5 years old iPhone devices working still like the first time.I don't care about the screen being smaller than other smartphones nowadays, because I don't watch much video on my phones, I'm minimalist so I just keep a few apps for messaging and photos and that's it.The battery life is great, but charging takes like 1.5 hours.Typing is something that will take me a few more days to get used to, coming from a 5 inches screen, but it is something I can live with.",14

So if you prefer larger phones I'd suggest the iPhone 6, this phone otherwise is very similar performance rise with the iPhone 6s it just does not have 3D Touch which I don't care for, it's also around $200 cheaper than a iPhone 6s.

A beautiful, operating phone...When I opened the brown shipping box, I was surprised they didn't pad the inside more, but everything was in great shape. The white iPhone box was still sealed, but the phone's protective film had some scratching on it, so I'm not sure what that was about.

Apple iPhone SE Unlocked Phone - 64 GB Retail Packaging - Silver,Apple,514.98,5,Only bought this new phone as an upgrade to my Iphone 4.,0
Apple iPhone SE Unlocked Phone - 64 GB Retail Packaging - Silver,Apple,514.98,5,"This iPhone gives me nostalgia, but not because of it's ""retro"" design remembering the 5s. It feels nostalgic because 10 years ago I used to carry similar sized digital cameras to capture my life in photos.When smartphones became more powerful with better cameras I still waited because they still lagged in a few things and getting a small point and shoot was still a much better value for money.The SE makes the iPhone devices 'more affordable' and it is the smartphone that has finally convinced me to ""upgrade"" my portable photography philosophy to use it as my only camera for everything. The pictures are clear, beautiful, they are much better in low light than with point and shoot cameras, the camera app is super easy, and the shutter is fast fast fast. That was I was looking for.Speaking about software, wow what can I say that hasn't been told already? iOS is very fluid and minimalist, with no bloatware, something I appreciate A LOT. With Android, even with high end devices, you still feel some hicups and lag from time to time, but iOS is the king of ""smoothness"". I've even seen 5 years old iPhone devices working still like the first time.I don't care about the screen being smaller than other smartphones nowadays, because I don't watch much video on my phones, I'm minimalist so I just keep a few apps for messaging and photos and that's it.The battery life is great, but charging takes like 1.5 hours.Typing is something that will take me a few more days to get used to, coming from a 5 inches screen, but it is something I can live with.",14

So if you prefer larger phones I'd suggest the iPhone 6, this phone otherwise is very similar performance rise with the iPhone 6s it just does not have 3D Touch which I don't care for, it's also around $200 cheaper than a iPhone 6s.

Apple iPhone SE Unlocked Phone - 64 GB Retail Packaging - Silver,Apple,514.98,4,"long time not use a iphone. as the high price until this one.phone is good,faster than 5s.i tried the game modern combate 5 on iphone se and my samsung galaxy S7,load the game and load the mission,iphone se made them faster than s7 about 3 secs.and the fingerprint unlock is almost the same,please note that if you use the iphone se oftenly,it unlocks the screen very fast,if you don't it will take 1-2secs more to get it done.and the only thing i don't like is upside of the screen is yellow,just a little than the other parte of the screen.it is a hardware issue,maybe apple using the screens of 5s to their iphone se.those screen are new but born 2 years ago.so i gave it 4 stars for this issue,not a big deal but you can tell.hope this would help you!",3
Apple iPhone SE Unlocked Phone - 64 GB Retail Packaging - Silver,Apple,514.98,5,"Since so far I am the only reviewer with an iPhone SE, I see it as my duty to present this iPhone to you. Yes, I do have this phone (sorry I have in Rose Gold, but workmanship is the same) and I am writing a real review (pictures provided!).Okay, there has been a hype for about a few months now, and the new 4"" iPhone is finally here. Some important points to take note of are that this phone has the exact same body as the iPhone 5 and 5s. Literally the exact same. Unlike the 6s that was slightly larger than the iPhone 6, this iPhone will fit each and every case and screen protector made for the iPhone 5 and 5s. Really the only difference is that this phone comes with matte edges instead of chrome, and the legal labels on the back are removed.The next point was that this phone is better than the iPhone 6 (and much cheaper). Don't let the 4"" screen fool you, this iPhone's stats are mostly on par or better than the iPhone 6 (and no, bigger screen is not better). Take the resolution. 326 ppi, same as iPhone 6. A9 chip, better and faster than the A8 in the iPhone 6. If pictures are your thing, there is a 12-megapixel iSight camera, better than the one in the iPhone 6. Don't forget Improved noise reduction, also better than the iPhone 6. Don't forget the panorama that features up to 63 megapixels, you guessed it, better than the iPhone 6's 43 megapixels. Oh, and I almost forgot (not really), 4K video is a blast. For selfies, the iPhone SE now features Retina flash, or flash from the screen. Battery life: the iPhone SE has the best battery life of all iPhone for sale today in terms of internet use time.So should you upgrade? I will start with those without a contract. If you hold any iPhone with a 4"" screen or smaller, and you are free from any contracts, then yes you should upgrade. This includes current users of iPhone 1/3G/3GS/4/4S/5/5c/5s. Here's why. If you are without a contract, you probably paid more for your current phone than you will for this one. Given that you were able to afford a full price iPhone, you can definitely enjoy the features of this phone. The way I see it, this phone is the perfect way to enjoy an iPhone 6s without the huge cost (and the 3D touch).iPhone 6 users, this one is a 50/50 call. You really should be happy with your phone, but, then again, I pretty much just trashed your phone in the specs throw down above. This one is a tough call, and one you and your wallet should decide.Those with a contract, if your contract is almost over, rejoice, you can get this phone for free. But, since you are shopping on Amazon for this phone, I assume you are not in a contract. However, if you are still in a contract for a while, it is up to you to decide if this phone is worth breaking your contract over.I hope you enjoyed reading this review more than I enjoyed writing it. If you have any questions, my email is on my profile page, and you should feel free to contact me. I, however, am not a representative from Apple, and you might just get better answers there. Who knows?",15

The phone responds very fast and I am still not done customizing it to what I want. This is what I like about Android as opposed to the iPhone. By the way I also have an iPhone so I can speak from a position of knowledge and familiarity with it. More comments if I can after I have had the phone for a little longer.

Samsung i897 Captivate Android Smartphone Galaxy S GSM Unlocked - Black,,87.99,1,"I am really dissapointed with my purchase. First of all, I must say that when I purchased this phone, the website clearly said NEW (not used or refurbished). Phone came in a generic box (not the original from samsung), and it only included battery, charger, and the phone itself. No headphones, or USB cable. Its funny that the box included a plastic tray that doesnt even fit the phone. It's also worth mentioning that I bought two of these phones, and the charger was not the same for both (which leads me to think that one of them is not the original charger). Phone came with two small scratches in the back. One of the edges of the screen showed small remains of silicone, which was really weird, and also made me think that the screen was probably replaced in the past.I tried to forget all those things because I really needed the phone at this moment, but my real surprise came when I turned it on and tried to make or receive a call. No sound at all. People cannot hear me, and I cannot hear them. I made sure the phone was configured correctly by checking all the settings, volume, mic, etc. Everything was perfectly configured and yet AUDIO WAS DEAD for phone calls. I am really really dissapointed with this seller. Not recommended.",1

Samsung i897 Captivate Android Smartphone Galaxy S GSM Unlocked - Black,,87.99,4,"For the past 5 years, I moved quiete a bit and didn't stay long enough in one place to get a decent plan with any carrier to get a good phone. That is how I got stuck with my Motorola SLVR for 5 years until I got this little piece of marvel.The good:- Versatile- I haven't ran into an area where it doesn't have a signal- GOOD and intuitive screen- Connects with Macs (through doubleTwist)*- Slim- Fast- Works in Costa Rica (where I'm from, sadly)- The camera is ok despite not having a flash- Once you've gotten the hang of it, you'll love itThe bad:- Every now and then while typing, it freezes then pours everything you did on the screen- Battery life (as most smartphones)* I mention this cause being a media producer and mostly photographer, I LIVE through my mac. I was bummed out at first, then I found out about doubleTwist. As a Media Player, stay away from it. As the tool to get your stuff ON the Galaxy, it does its job.I'm in love with this phone, it is NOT perfect, but the shortcomings are not something I consider enough to regret this purchase. For what it's worth, AT&T in the US sells it for almost $100 more unlocked and in Costa Rica, it's almost $700.Hope this helps and write me if you have other questions on the phone, more than glad to share my experience.",1

Well i had heard good things about the Samsung captivate phone and read some good reviews on it as well, but i turned out to be the unlucky one. I recieved my phone and it worked for one month and then started freezing up, and now im not able to make calls or recieve them...i can make the call but when the caller answers i cant hear them and they can't hear me either and its the same when they call me. I can text and get on the internet but no calls so i have to turn the phone off and take the battery out everytime i want to make a call so it will work for me...I am sooooooooo upset with this phone and the company i purchased it from. Worldwide distributers is not a good company to purchase from, i called them back about this phone and they told me to take it the manufacture that they can't help me.

(If you have any issues with the 3G just set the APN on settings)The cell phone itself blows your mind!! I wont talk about it much because there are excellent reviews about it here... but I'll say good things and bad ones:1) GOOD ONES: The 4 inch AMOLED screen is far up one of the best of the market! android system works great! 16 Gb of memory that ensures you of thousands of apps to download! and I actually got the cell phone UNLOCKED, ROOTED and upgraded to Android Gingerbread 2.3.3!!! (bought from devices now)2) BAD ONES: The only thing that isn't great about the phone itself is that the battery runs out very fast if you use it for videos, games or excessive use of applications. No flash with the camera...Excellent cell phone for new android users like me... very accessible price vs. other cell phones on the market (Especialmente si usan CADIVI!! jajaja) and it was shipped two days after I bought it via UPS!! it arrived like 3 days before the shipping estimate!! I strongly recommend Devices Now as a seller... you won't regret!",16

I don't know if it is a software glitch or a hardware issue but other than that, I really love the phone. I love it's design, especially how thin it is. Speed is nice too.

Samsung i897 Captivate Android Smartphone Galaxy S GSM Unlocked - Black,,87.99,2,"The Captivate is ok in terms of speed and multitasking, but speaking as an iPhone (Jailbreak) user for the last 4 years the andriod OS was rather lack lustre. It is clunky, and not intuitive as everyone leads one to believe. The big big claim that Android plays Flash (even though the most current version is installed) does not play (EPIC FAIL!). Claims that it plays websites without the issues that the iPhone supposedly has is complete and total BULL! I Use Linux for my home computer system, my whole family does, but Android (that uses Linux) seems more like Windows Vista compared to IOS on the iPhone. Don't Believe the Android HYPE! For One Second! iPhone (Jailbroken) THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE! Rooting Better effin deliver, because out of the box it is TERRIBLE! The Captivate in and of itself is an ok so so phone but my GOD the brightness is out of control, even with it's lowest setting would keep the neighbours awake at night (Don't even waste your time with brightness widgets they all fail with a D- on their functionality. One more reason why I prefer the iPhone, It has common sense brightness settings. The only thing I can really brag about on this phone is the display.

Samsung i897 Captivate Android Smartphone Galaxy S GSM Unlocked - Black,,87.99,4,"Well the Samsung Captivate has its good features probably the camera is the best of all. The camera has 5 mega pixels and has many shooting modes and it takes great pictures the auto focus is extremely good zoom could be better but still it shoots great crisp photos the phone also has a great screen very bright but battery consuming. One of the biggest cons would be the processor I think the phone is a bit too slow for some apps and androids operating system doesn't help it leaves programs on the background running and makes the phone crash so you need to download a app called system that lets you manage your apps and se your cpu, ram memory, cpu clock and many other useful things. This app helps a lot but still its not the best because no matter what I did I could not play GTA on my phone with out some lag so this is not a phone for those people who like to play on their phones but every thing else It does a great job. Camera, Gps Google voice the screen are all pros to the phone the cons would be the battery processor and the charging input is kind of annoying up there.oh and don't buy from Sold by: Young Kimbrough (seller profile)the package came all wrapped with paper and it wasn't the original box it was a crappy Chinese box that said Samsung.",1

The next problem i'm have is the phone keeps sticking. even though i have an app to optimize the RAM and also another to kill apps, the phone still continue to stick.3. Last night i tried charging my phone but the phone just would not charge i tried using different power outlets but still the phone would not charge. i connected the data cable to see it there was a problem with the cable itself but when i connected the cable to the computer the phone began charging so the problem is with the AC adapter that the cable connects to. This phone is just three weeks old and i have had so many issues with this phone.

I bought from Unlocked Cell Phone Kings Inc. The battery life isn't too bad as well, although I don't think you would be able to use the phone much if you don't charge every two days.Having owned this phone for over a month, I have discovered a number of problems.

I think that captivate i897 is a good example of relation quality/price and you can get a lot of features by a low cost. Appearance is a remarkable aspect.

It arrived in plain at&t box. Manual looks like it was homemade, and has no Samsung TMs on it anywhere. Despite all that, the phone is absolutely brand new. Second ""weird"" thing was that my internal speaker (the one you listen to when you receive calls) was not working until I plugged headphones jack in and out of the socket. Now it seems to be fine.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.PS. 4 months later update: power button stopped working.

Samsung i897 Captivate Android Smartphone Galaxy S GSM Unlocked - Black,,87.99,5,"I bought a couple of weeks and is fully operational, had made these comments but I deleted the page because the were in Spanish, I'm from Venezuela, I looked forward to the arrival of my phone, first came locked, without enbargo, the I contact a seller sent me the unlock codes, or rather informed me that came in the box, only I did not know that those numbers were, the change from a Nokia E63 Samsung i897 Captivate this Android smartphone Galaxy S has been from heaven to earth, is a versatile phone and thousands of things to do and learn every day, to be released works perfect with Digitel and Movistar (although with the service costs a little more recognition of network services and on the SIM), but all good, is the best investment I ever made in terms of phone and it came in love with Android, Nokia now and again .. I recommend it faithfully",0
Samsung i897 Captivate Android Smartphone Galaxy S GSM Unlocked - Black,,87.99,4,"Here's a minimalist who jumped from a bulky Sprint phone to the magical Motorola Razr and then wooed by the half bit Apple. My first Smart Phone was an iPhone 3GS, and then a natural upgrade to an iPhone 4 (not the S). And to be direct: I would never have know this beauty (Captivate/Android) existed had I never sought some 'free' air (open source platforms).It does what you expect: whether you go by specs (1 GHz CPU, a GPU core, AMOLED hi res screen, a sleek design that stands out..), by user experience (bright clear icons, fast response), or by developer satiety (more control over the software/feature, freedom to install OS versions - supported or custom).In objectivity, the iPhones have always set the bar too high in user experience and the quality of both hardware and the software. So I am not a be-grudged Apple departee - in fact I keep looking for features I liked from iPhone on the Android. However, I have been very positively impressed by what the Captivate (with Android 2.2) offered right away.I took one star off the rating, because be all the great that it is, Android on this cool piece of hardware still is an edgy phone mostly for the geeky ones. There are things you can tweak, software you can write yourself, that opens a 4th world of creativity. However, not everyone may want to do that and may want to trust a closed-form Apple-is solution that just works right out of the box - the same way - everyday.And now to my opinion on an iPhone v/s an Android smartphone (specifically the Captivate):An iPhone will be smarter than you are, eventually making you a dumb-er user (since it will take away most of the thinking away from the user, really - they are SO GOOD with UI:-), whileAn Android phone (esp Captivate), though not as smart a phone as an iPhone4, gives a heaven full of creativity, blissful moments of tweaking the SW, settings, and Apps, and in my opinions makes you a smart-er user.So depending upon your taste, if you like your smartness replaced reliably, you may like the closed-environment iPhones. However, if you want a device that augments your intelligence, try out the community-spirited Android phones like the Captivate - you might just start enjoying enabling phones all over again:-)[Updated 3.01.2012] A word of caution for 11th St Wireless customers. I paid $19 more from them hoping they will ship me a genuine phone. The box was genuine. The phone is great, I love it. But I think they cheated on the headset. The box says (as it should) that it has a stereo headset. But the one I was shipped in the box (NEW) is *MONO*. It is cheaply made and no Samsung mark on it. In fact it looks NOTHING like the real ones that show in customer pictures above. I contacted 11th St Wireless re: this. They came back and said they sold me ONLY the phone and I should talk to the seller I bought the headset from. WHAT?!? The headset comes WITH THE PHONE in the package, in its box!!! I have requested clarification, pending a negative response I will contact Amazon directly to rate them out negatively. Please everyone BEWARE and be aware of what you are getting in the box! Still loving the phone though, it has MIUI on it now:-)[Updated 1.30.2012] A word of caution: The first time I bought this item, the seller was OEM Planet. The price looked very competitive. I paid 2 day shipping too. But beware: I had items missing from the box (data cable, CDs, headphones, all missing), and the unit looked used (scratches). 11th wireless was an excellent seller, whom I used upon returning the first item. The second time, I received a box that was more authentic looking, with a real manual in there and the complete kit.",10

I want to give it more stars, but it's not a regular Verizon network phone. It is apparently a prepaid phone incapable of normal activation on Verizon, unless it's especially set up to be used on the regular network [clearing the ESN and unlocking it for regular network use]. The seller didn't advise me it was a ""prepaid"" Verizon phone. So my experience is not really the fault of the phone as much as it's a dysfunctional seller. But I give this warning that a lot of these models are incapable of being used normally on Verizon unless unblocked and cleared first.",0

It does have many features that I'll never use, (using the phone on Page Plus Wireless is limited), but it's a nice feature filled phone. The only drawback I have with it is that the battery life is a bit short. To get around the short battery life, I have disable some of the constant updates that uses data and turn them on only when I need updates. I did notice that when the data is off the picture text didn't work. I now leave the data on all the time. Over all, it's a good buy for me.",2

Samsung Illusion I110 Verizon CDMA Prepaid Android Cell Phone - Black/Silver,Samsung,39.99,4,"...and I don't mean that as a put-down. It's not the latest iPhone or Android wonder machine -- not that I've gotten close close to one -- but it was inexpensive and works with PagePlus network. It can handle Google Drive documents, which is a nice plus for this Chromebook user.It's also a nice phone for my wife's first smartphone. She is basically a talker / texter, and although the touch screen has been tricky for her, the Illusion is user friendly enough that she hasn't thrown it at the wall... yet :)UPDATE 2014.04.23 -->It's still a nice, basic smart phone as far as handling apps, but I felt like I needed to come back and say that if you're going to use it on the PagePlus network, it will not update the operating system automatically. That may contribute to some buggy behavior in the phone operations -- sometimes I can't get the virtual keypad to show up during a call (like when I need to press a number), and sometimes pressing a number on the virtual keypad doesn't work. I'm not sure if that's just because it hasn't been updated (due to being off the Verizon network) or just the phone itself, but there you go. It's gotten so irritating that I'm ready to try rooting it, even if that makes it unusable. I'm ready for a phone with analog buttons again, I think.And yes, it does go through battery life quickly when you have your apps updating automatically.",5

Samsung Infuse I997 4G 16GB Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone w/ 8MP Camera - Black,,124.99,5,"I actually bought the Infuse to use as a media player, not a phone (I already have a Samsung S3 mini that I'm very happy with). With the high-quality Wolfson DAC built into the Infuse, and the VooDoo app support for the DAC, sound quality is amazing for both music and video. It doesn't have a ""Retina"" display, and some reviewers constantly knock Samsung Android device displays; frankly, I don't see a problem. The screen looks good with both video and graphics. Battery life has been good even when watching video; however, some games seem to eat more battery than others.The device is no longer getting any update support from Samsung, but it's easily rooted and there are plenty of ROM options out there on the XDA forum. Although Gingerbread was the last ""official"" version of Android on the Infuse, I'm running Jelly Bean via the Carbon ROM with no trouble whatsoever. With a 64gb microSD card in the expansion slot, I've got plenty of room for app data and media.The Infuse has been a great media player since I got it, and there's the added bonus of having a spare phone if something happens to my S3 mini. This phone is proof that you don't always need the absolute latest gear. Definitely recommended.",1

Samsung Infuse I997 4G 16GB Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone w/ 8MP Camera - Black,,124.99,3,"I thought that I had made a great purchase.....but this phone was a disappointment. It worked really well for about a week. Now, I am having too many problems with this phone. I have to swipe keys( talk, speaker, number keypad, etc.) several times. When using the speaker, the phone continually goes low and back to loud position. While holding a conversation, I lose sound. I cannot hear the other person talking for several seconds. I would not recommend this phone to anyone.",0
Samsung Infuse I997 4G 16GB Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone w/ 8MP Camera - Black,,124.99,5,"I purchased this phone because I broke my iPhone 5S and need something to hold me over till my next upgrade. This phone is amazing for it's price. It has the same level of technology as the iPhone 4S I would say. All the apps from the iPhone App Store are available on the Apps for Android.This phone doesn't hold battery very well and it runs a little slow (I'm hoping this will improve with a software update). Other than that, for $100 this was a steal. The phone was refurbished but looked brand new.I would recommend a protective case because the screen is glass and the phone is very thin. The back cover is a very flimsy plastic.",0

Because of a time crunch, I had to have a working phone and could not wait for them to fix the phone and F&S Cellular took it back and immediately refunded my purchase and shipping cost for me. I am sad that I had to go with another phone, but was very impressed by their customer service that I would certainly buy from them and also recommend F&S Cellular to anyone.",0

Samsung Intensity SCH-U450 No Contract Verizon Cell Phone,,62.99,4,"I ordered this phone on Amazon recently to replace a stolen one of the same model. I chose to get this phone again to save on costs (No $30/mo. data fee from Verizon), and because it was a pretty good phone. The replacement has matched its predecessor in all qualities. You can drop it a hundred times and it'll still work fine. The keyboard (though retro nowadays) is comfortable to type with. Best of all, its cheap (just $30 or so, so you don't have to worry much when your phone gets stolen). It performs all the basic functions you would expect of a phone of this style. Battery life is great, and the battery itself never needed to be replaced.Negatives: I have noticed that the call quality can be quite poor, so if you spend alot of time on the phone in noisy areas, this is not the best choice for you. Texting conversations can be annoying since you get booted out from any text you're typing if someone else texts you. I also recommend that you stick with the black colored version. The replacement phone I ordered was red and it's just too conspicuous (I did know it would be red at the time of ordering, however).I recommend if you're looking for a simple and cheap phone.",0

I never rated any product as a 1 star before. If there was a zero rating, that would have been my preference for rating this product. After 2 months the phone started mal-functioning, after 4 months it got worse,and after 6 months, it stopped working altogether. The configuration went completely hay-wire and nothing worked. When I contacted the seller, they referred me to Samsung, since the product carried a no warranty notice. I don't think I am up for the run around, so may just count my losses. In future, I have to re-think any purchases with the no warranty notice. We all learn from experience. Only because I trusted Amazon, and never had problems before did I make this purchase. I guess the no warranty notice is there for a reason! Once you see 'NO WARRANTY' don't buy. Dissatisfied to say the least.",0
"Samsung Jet S8000 Unlocked Phone with 3G, Quad-Band GSM, 5 MP Camera, and 2 GB Memory--International Version No Warranty (Black)",Samsung,169.99,5,"I've had this phone for a year now and love it. Got T-Mobile for it and I use it every day. It's been through alot and still works like the day I got it, but with quite a few nicks, scratches, and even dents on the sides. Most of which were my friends fault for taking my phone and messing with it. I'd suggest getting a case for it. Just incase you have crazy friends that like to take your phone like me. The screen get's lots of finger prints and grease on it but what phone doesn't? If you get water or in many of my cases sweat on the screen it'll wack out or just stop working until it's cleaned and dried. Hasn't ever been a big problem for me but there could be times when you stuck in the rain, need to call for a ride, and the screen won't work because one too many droplets got on it. The camera and video camera are great, can take really good pictures and video aslong as you don't use zoom or shake it too much, the phone looks cool, has good sound, and has served me well. I payed 220 bucks for it and is worth every penny.",0

"Samsung Jet S8000 Unlocked Phone with 3G, Quad-Band GSM, 5 MP Camera, and 2 GB Memory--International Version No Warranty (Black)",Samsung,169.99,1,"....much worse than I thought.Bought the Jet to replace my Nokia E61i and read few evaluations here and in specialized magazines before opting for the Jet instead of iPhone.On the positive side: its screen is really good and it's smaller and thinner than iPhone and my previous phone. It also has a ""block"" button on the right side, which proved to be very handy.Now, on the negatives:- the phone is not user-friendly. A quick example: there is a toolbar on the left side that you can slide and where there are shortcuts to the most used functions, very similar to the Windowns toolbar in a desktop. But, once you use any of the funcionts, say the ""Profile"" function, the icon of that same function moves automatically to the main screen and stays there! In other words, every time you use any of those icons, you have to move it back to the left bar. Needless to say, for someone not used to the screen, it's really a pain, extremely annoying. When I was testing my phone for the first time and haven't realized about this feature, I ended up with tons of icons in my main screen and had to move them to the left bar, one by one....- the software to perform the interface between your PC and Jet (PC Studio) is extremely UNfriendly. Unlike the previous software that I used with my Nokia (where I could, for instance, transfer files from/and to my mobile very easily), the Samsung software is full of coloured icons but it's extremely complicated to use- the manual and different wizards aren't much helpful. I needed to get the IMEI and PIN codes of my device to set up my email and I had to check on the Internet to figure out how to get those codes in my phone (in Nokia, for example, I could easily check those in the Internet/email menus).All in all, I'm very dissastified with the phone, even being only 2 days that I bought it. Already considering buying an iPhone or going for some of the HTC models....",2

A nice little feature is that it has a hole on the upper left part of the case for attaching a lanyard or a neck loop. She loops it around her neck, to be available if she falls, helps her find it, and keeps it safe from dropping. The last Samsung was a tough little bugger, hoping the same for this one. Only criticism is that Amazon kinda implied that it came with a cradle, it didn't. But they have them for about $7.

It took me an hour to get this answer and when I called today to activate they said that plan had been discontinued a while back. I was fairly mad because going with their $15 a month prepaid plan would cost $100 a year more than the plan my mom is on now. Then I remembered Page Plus Cellular and activated the phone through them. $10 every 120 days for 100 minutes. Perfect for my mom who only keeps the phone for emergencies. She doesn't even leave it on in her purse. I don't think she has ever made a call from her current phone. This is the ideal solution and the best phone for this use, very simple and easy to use.

Samsung Korea Galaxy Grand II Duos G7102 Black Factory Unlocked Android International Version Phone - Retail Packaging - Black,Samsung Korea,270,4,"Okay, I REALLY wanted the new Samsung Note 4 (am I allowed to write that here?) However, I have such a GREAT prepaid plan that I can't bear to give up and I would NOT swallow the $750 price tag. So, I bought this little number and I like it. I love the big screen, I like the samsung format. (I'm already familiar with it!) I also love the camera. My other phone was serviceable, but 3 years old and starting to get buggy in it's erratic behavior, so this one is faster, bigger and beautiful. My only hiccup is the phone has a little icon in the corner prompting me to download Kitkat, and there are several online reviews vehemently warning against the pairing of this device and Kitkat! The reminder will not go away, nor can it be deleted and feels a bit like impending doom. In the mean time it meets my needs nicely and does not have the same big fat price tag as it's competitors. Hooray for a way to beat the system of pricey phone service. I would really give this phone 4.5 stars. :)",1

Not to mention its dual sim operation is trouble free. I am yet to experience a frozen screen, or any glitch in its response, and believe me I have pushed this phone to the limit for the 2 months I have had it .... the battery life is great! The phone itself is quite user-friendly in its layout an setup, and will be a great experience for the new smartphone user. One problem I encountered though is the Samsung software isn't notifications friendly, and it didnt have notification for FB, BBM, Whatsapp,viber etc., that bothered me for a bit. However, there is an app to fix that ""notifyer"" ....now my phone works perfect!! I wouldn't trade it for the world",5

It worked perfectly. Great features for a ""low budget"" phone. It had some software problems when I got it, like it was really unstable, but then I updated the software and it was just fine. Then the GPS stopped working and I could no longer navigate outside my zip code. Then the frame started peeling. Here I was thinking it was metal or something but it looks like it's just shiny metal paint. Once it starts peeling in one area, there's no stopping the spread. Even with the case on it's still peeling. Little tiny chips come off everytime I remove the case, and I can't not remove the case because I hate grimy phones, and I change cases very often.",0

Samsung Korea Galaxy Grand II Duos G7102 Black Factory Unlocked Android International Version Phone - Retail Packaging - Black,Samsung Korea,270,4,"I had the same phone that I purchased from India. I dropped it and the screen shattered. Samsung US will not do anything as was asking me to send the phone back to India. So I bought another here in US as I could not find any other phone that suits my needs better.My observations with the one I got from Amazon:1. The box is actually opened. I guess this is to put the US plug adapter in the box. A new Samsung logo seal was placed over the older broken seal. The phone comes all wrapped up so it is difficult to say if the phone was tampered with.2. The original adapter is for India. But the Firmware rev. is different from the ones you get on Indian Grand 2. Maybe this is to remove the region locking. Downside is, I got Kitkat update on the phone I got from India. However, I am not sure if I will be lucky to get the update on the new phone. Software update says everything is up-to-date . but I am still on 4.33. Headphones that came in the box is very cheap. Though it has samsung logo, I am sure its fake samsung. The one that I got in the India version is way better.The phone as such is great and I dont regret buying it the second time. I am only a bit nervous that the box was opened once and that the FW flashed is of a different version. So far I didn't see any problems. Will update if I see any.",9

Samsung Korea Galaxy Grand II Duos G7102 Black Factory Unlocked Android International Version Phone - Retail Packaging - Black,Samsung Korea,270,4,"The phone does its expected job. . I don't love it, but I also don't hate it. . I had problems getting it to work on the AT&T network when I first bought it but the guy at the ATT store helped adjust some settings and now I have no problem connecting. I took it to Sweden and put a Telenor card in. That worked ok but the phone often won't pick up the data for the second sim. I installed SwiftKey app to solve the really poor autocorrect capabilities on the phone. I installed rocket dialer to improve the phone interface. The biggest problems I have with it is switching data to sim 2 correctly. Phone and text for sim2 is perfect.I like the size and the display is pretty darn good. The performance is fine on 3g, I don't miss the 4g speed like I thought I would. You can't buy screen protectors or cases except on Amazon I have found but that is not a big crisis for me. I got a great case here.Overall it does exactly what I had hoped it would do. I only need one phone while travelling abroad. I do wish I could uninstalled half of the crap apps Samsung put on the phone though. Seems like since I bought it and paid in full for it I should be able to uninstall these useless apps that take up space and memory.",3

It worked perfectly. Great features for a ""low budget"" phone. It had some software problems when I got it, like it was really unstable, but then I updated the software and it was just fine. Then the GPS stopped working and I could no longer navigate outside my zip code. Then the frame started peeling. Here I was thinking it was metal or something but it looks like it's just shiny metal paint. Once it starts peeling in one area, there's no stopping the spread. Even with the case on it's still peeling. Little tiny chips come off everytime I remove the case, and I can't not remove the case because I hate grimy phones, and I change cases very often.",0

So after a long research I found this phone and the Sony Experia. Thankfully, after almost a year of using this phone, my niece continues to use it without any issues what so ever.

Samsung Korea Galaxy Note 3 Neo N7505 16GB GSM 4G LTE Hexa-Core Smartphone with Pen Stylus - Unlocked - (Black),Samsung,234.29,3,"The N7505 is an International version, which means that this device was designed to work with other countries' bands: LTE band 1(2100), 3(1800), 5(850), 7(2600), 8(900), 20(800) . Please note that NO ONE of these bands are used in USA by major carriers like T-Mobile or AT&T, so this device will only get 2G speeds in places that have 4G, and maybe 3G speeds in those places that have not been "" Reframed"" yet, so they still provide HSPA 3G bands. Otherwise, it is a nice device, the pen stylus works really well, good screen resolution and decent camera. If your organization email requires your device to be encrypted you will find that the main encryption login is in Polish and cannot be changed, also encrypting the phone will cause a more frequent automatic resets. Bottom line: a mediocre performance network and low reliability because it resets a lot. There are cheaper phones with less issues out there.",0

Samsung Korea Galaxy S3 Mini I8200 8GB Value Edition Unlocked GSM Phone - Retail Packaging - Grey,Samsung,199,4,"I really liked this phone, not only for the Android experience it offers but also for the size, which was very important to me. I am not into the large phones so I sought out small smartphones and came across the Galaxy Mini series of phones. This was a really good deal, even with the phone's flaws and drawbacks. The phone is running 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) and according to AT&T and Samsung, neither of them can upgrade the firmware version on this phone to the most recent Android that was made available for other variants of the S3 Mini because it is an international version. The Samsung Experience Center at my local Best Buy tried to help but were also unable. Even while the Android version isn't the latest it still offers, does, and has a lot- especially with using Google services to get cross-device integration, so there's not too much I can't do from my phone or that I can't also access via my laptop. The phone itself can run hot sometimes when running many apps and can also lag quite a bit when trying to navigate between several apps at once. Rather low RAM and internal memory, something an micro SD card can't help or change, but I do have a 32GB one in my phone that I save anything I can to in an effort to conserve the phone's internal memory. Battery life could be much better, barely gets through half a day without needing to charge but it's manageable for my lifestyle. Also pretty sturdy and durable build. Had no problems with connectivity for wifi or my service provider. At one point the headphone port was causing any headset inserted to play only through one ear, happened suddenly and randomly went back to normal about a week after it initially started, hasn't done it since. The speakers could be much louder but it's decent.This is my first TouchWiz experience and must say I'm not in love with it but using the phone all in all is pretty straightforward, easy, and convenient.",2
Samsung Korea Galaxy S3 Mini I8200 8GB Value Edition Unlocked GSM Phone - Retail Packaging - Grey,Samsung,199,3,"The phone has been working great off of wifi, but now that I have a sim in, it won't read it. Tried rebooting, etc. Will continue to try and then attempt a return and update accordingly. Phone was as expected, comporable to my S5, camera is only 5MP, so it's not amazing, but it does the job.",1

Samsung Korea Galaxy S3 Mini I8200 8GB Value Edition Unlocked GSM Phone - Retail Packaging - Grey,Samsung,199,5,"Going from a windows phone to Android phone.Let me just say this is the media player would have to be my favorite app on my phone Iuse it all the time and it puts windows media player to shame with the ability to stream my music to my XBOX 360.My biggest gripe is all the things needed to be accessed by the apps, do you really need to have access to my contacts?One game I like playing on windows and android is AE jewels the android version has the stupid micro transaction andannoying ads that pop up before you play the game unlike the windows phone with a ad on the bottom.As long as they don't mess with the media player like windows did I will be a happy camper.I will update this review after a few months of use.PS. My Nokia charger works with the phone and so far I have had no issues with using a U.S. charger.So far I have had this phone for 3 months now and it's working real good, my only complaint is the weather app that isincluded with it stopped working.Does anyone know how to set the alarm on this phone I tried looking everywhere?",1

I bought one for my girlfriend and my surprise once I get it in Venezuela was the refurbished sticker inside the cellphone when it was sell (and paid) as new. Additionally the baterry that came with it wasn't original but a chinese replica and once the battery reaches between 30 and 40% the cellphones turns off. This buyings looks like a lottery to me.,1

Samsung Korea SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 MINI GT-i9195 LTE 8GB- FACTORY UNLOCKED International Version - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - White(NO WARRANTY),Samsung,379,1,"The device arrived the same day than other products despite the extra $$$ for the two day shipping. It was late if we consider that was expected after two labor days. It was a waste to have two shipping days...The device itself is great. I had the old vibrant S4G from t-mobile but just broke its screen. This G4Smini is just a little bit bigger but best replacement. I do not like the super sized S4. The model is the GT-I9195 from somewhere in europe (france?). It comes with a brochure from the mobile company Orange. After charged, I turned it on and asked me the preferred language, data for account logins and internet. Created some accounts as well and finally was up and running fine. The charger has a plug useful in some countries in europe and many other countries in latam etc. The seller included an adapter for the US connector. The box itself appeared unopened with its seal intact, but a more careful look showed that the seal was on top of a previously broken seal. Both seems to be official but who knows how hard can be to make a sticker with the words ""samsung"" on it... The device had plenty of plastics protecting all the sides and corners so it looks ""enough"" new to me.The cons:- horrible boot screen. No idea how to replace it without rooting the phone.- many not needed applications you cannot uninstall unless rooting the device (as most smartphones).- it uses microSIM cards... No idea why since it has plenty of space for the regular SIM cards. I had to buy a cutter to trim my old SIM.- the device comes with android 4.2.2. I was expecting something more recent. At least 4.3, or an update. But no....- its price feels way too high for a device with only 8GB of internal memory (already shared with OS and the several updates to its original apps).I recommend the product but knowing in advance its details.EDIT: Be aware that as with previous model, Samsung messed it up. Firmware 4.2.2 ""allows"" to move apps to SD to free internal memory space. But it is not true... all it does is to say it did it, but it only moves the apps to a sort of partition or folder ""./emulate/0"" on the same INTERNAL MEMORY!!!! Checked many forum and this issue is reported since S III, but is still not solved by Samsung.Some stated that firmware 4.3 may solve it but my Kies still says 4.2.2 is the latest firmware.This is a HUGE fault on this device. My previous S4G Vibrant, really moved the apps to the SD as most android devices. It is one of the plus over iPhones. But this one, more modern and very expensive device just fakes it. Do not get confused by Samsung Support FAQ stating this is only due to developpers of some apps not using SD compatibility, because no one app was in fact moved to the SD card. All went to the emulated area inside the internal memory despite stating the app was moved to SD. I even checked my SD card on linux to see all hidden forldes and NADA. No one app was moved there, not even a folder was created to do so. Google this issue and you will find many forums showing this problem.I do not like when manufacturers LIE and sellers do nothing to inform their customers about what the product really is. This bug is known since long time and the seller should know the products they sell. When I press move to SD, and it says it did it, I expect to find it on the SD card. Too much to ask?My internal memory is getting full by just having built-in apps auto-updated.I am overseas now. Otherwise I would ask for a full refund.No, I do not recommend this product until Samsung offers a firmware update that solves this issue.",18

I moved up from a galaxy s2, and I'm glad I did. I prefer the smaller size of this phone versus the newer, larger mobile computers that everyone is carrying. The size makes it easier to use with one hand. Fits into my pocket easier, also.I purchased this phone unlocked and noticed all the literature inside the box was in Spanish. Once I turned the phone on, I setup it up for English as I'm in the USA. The Samsung service automatically transferred my settings and files from my old phone to my new one. Also, I just went to T-mobile and got a micro-SIM and it works flawlessly. I think I'm getting another one for my wife.",1

Samsung Korea SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 MINI GT-i9195 LTE 8GB- FACTORY UNLOCKED International Version - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - White(NO WARRANTY),Samsung,379,4,"In USA: The phone is exactly what I wished it would be. I hoped that it would get 4G or at least 3G in the USA but it gets no data in the USA. However, it can be used to make phone calls in the USA (I am using ATT in the states and the phone is supposed to be unlocked. I have a normal Samsung Galaxy S4 as my phone in the USA and it gets 4G with the same SIM card).In Brazil: I got this phone for traveling to Brazil and it has been great, I am with Claro in Belem. It get 4G in Brazil and I can make phone calls in Brazil. I downloaded KIK, Whatsapp, and Viber on the phone, all work perfectly. I use KIK and Whatsapp to text through WIFI and use Viber to make free phone calls to my family in the USA over WIFI.My only real complaint is that you do have the Samsung apps on it taking more space than I would like. The 8GB is very limiting on how many apps you can download because it keeps telling me that I am running out of space even though I have an external SD card that I have tried to put most of the apps on. If you're traveling looking for a good phone to use for traveling, this one has been perfect with the exception of no 4G in the USA but that more so deals with the way the two different countries having their data system set up.",2

Samsung Korea SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 MINI GT-i9195 LTE 8GB- FACTORY UNLOCKED International Version - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - White(NO WARRANTY),Samsung,379,2,"I bought this phone as a gift for my wife. The warehouse took a whole week to prepare the shipping. I found that very strange. Then they sent the item. The shipping package was Ok, but the box had a bump in a corner. I was worried about the phone but it looked fine. When I was ready to turn it on I noticed the plastic screen covering the camera had scratches, due to daily use. I realized the phone WAS NOT NEW, maybe a refurbished one or, in fact, a repaired used one.Then, after one day or two my wife said that the screen did not turn on during a call when she tried to see the display. That was weird, I thought maybe a setting could fix this. But I got surprised when I discovered that the proximity sensor WAS NOT WORKING!. So I installed an app that checks all the sensors the phone has and confirmed my fears.I decided to go further in the investigation, so I tested the light sensor. It was working, so the problem was the infrared transmitter. I took my personal phone, put it in camera mode and try to see if the infrared transmitter was working or not. It was transmitting but without enough power. My intuition said: ""what happens if the proximity sensor is loose?"" Looking at it from the front of the phone I notice the headphone did looked as loose. I though ""Maybe I can try applying a little force on it, without taking apart the phone...""Voil√°! The proximity sensor started to work! Sometimes it fails again but I know how to make it work for a little more. How about returning the item? Yes I did think on that, but it will cost me US$16 as I live in another country.Finally I can tell if you, seller FreeTaxStreEONethwe21, try to sell more of these phones, be accurate please and DO NOT SELL ""NEW"" THINGS IF THEY ARE NOT. We the people who buy things, trust that you will sell things exactly as you say in the description, so do not betray our trust.One last thing: the phone came unlocked and works great with ORANGE DOMINICANA, in the Dominican Republic, or DR.",3

Samsung is at the top of their game, I'm using it on ATTs GSM network thru a reseller called 'Consumer Cellular' in the US. The fact that it's an international version doesn't impact any features I'm aware of here. The slightly smaller footprint makes handling it better than all the super-sized units marketed in the US. I haven't dropped it once. The english(US) language pack works perfect. On initial power-up, the setup process let's you select the correct language. Very painless. I did have to manually configure mobile data over the phone with Consumer Cellular. It didn't do this automatically when I installed my SIM card, but I used wifi for weeks before taking the time to configure mobile data, (a 15 minute phone call) I setup software updates to happen over wifi only so it wasn't that important initially. 8GB of internal storage is lacking but it takes an additional 32GB micro SD which I'm using. Overall, great piece of hardware. Priced and sized perfectly. Android is amazingly intuitive, those google guys are also at the top of their game with much more to come, BRAVO!",4

Even with no programs/apps running the phone will die in a few hours (or less if she's using it a lot). A new phone shouldn't die that quickly.

Sometimes some apps dont work, it takes like 5 second to get into the pictures you have already taken. The signal is normal but I think other phones are better. Its annoying for whatsapp because when you hold the phone it records a voice message and sends it without previous notice. when you have it blocked the phone with a password you cant have a quick access to the camera or other things like you do in the iphone. It takes good pictures, but it takes a couple seconds sometimes to just open the camera. Now is having trouble to play the videos in some web pages because it just slowed down the audio.",0

Samsung Korea SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 MINI GT-i9195 LTE 8GB- FACTORY UNLOCKED International Version - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - White(NO WARRANTY),Samsung,379,5,"Let me just say I am loving this phone, I have only had it for 2 weeks and I am learning something new everyday. I really liked my Galaxy s3 mini too, but Straight Talk now has 4g LTE in my area and I wanted a phone that also had 4g. This is a great little phone, it is a little bit taller and a little narrower than the s3 mini, but when I put it in the case I can't really tell. It does seem a little faster than my s3 mini. I have gotten two days out of the battery, but I am not a heavy phone user. I play a few games like bejeweled, a little bit of texting, checking email, as an alarm clock and making phone calls. I very rarely use it to surf the web or watch videos. I am probably not the most techy person, but I have to say for my purposes this is a great phone and I would recommend it to anyone who does not want a huge phone, but still likes to have the quality of one. It did come unlocked and sealed, although like someone else it looked to have been opened and then resealed with an official seal. My guess is that SHOPBEST opened it to put in the plug adapter in it, so I could use it in the US without an issue. This is an inter national phone so the plug comes as a 220v and you need to put a converter on it for 110v. This is the mini version not the regular version. I knew all that coming in so be prepared if you don't read the product description to be surprised.",28

Samsung Korea SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 MINI GT-i9195 LTE 8GB- FACTORY UNLOCKED International Version - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - White(NO WARRANTY),Samsung,379,5,"The phone came very fast (despite the fact that the rest of my order has yet to even ship) and was as advertised. The box was sealed and it sure looks new. The only initial drawback is that the manual is in Hungarian. Also, it came with a European charger, but there was also an adapter and it all works so no complaints here. I was able to put an AT&T MicroSIM into the phone and it works great. Next big test will be to put a foreign SIM into it to see if it still works. The main reason for purchasing the phone is to be able to use it in both America and the UK/Ireland so that will be the true test. Overall, very happy with the purchase.

Samsung Korea SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 MINI GT-i9195 LTE 8GB- FACTORY UNLOCKED International Version - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - White(NO WARRANTY),Samsung,379,4,"I really like this phone. Its a big step up from my previous phone (google nexus-s), so of course it will be a huge improvement. Looks great, its fast, the screen feels and looks awesome, and its a very capable phone. I love ""dragging and dropping"" music and movies on to this phone with ease, unlike some other ""fruity"" phones. I purchased a Samsung EVO 32gb micro SD card along with this for about $20, and they work great together. The phone is a little light and definitely needs to be put in a good case immediately to protect the screen and beauty.I rated this OVERALL experience 4 stars - not because of the phone, but because of the ad in general. I know I could have done some better research, which I usually do, but I think it needs to be made clear that in the USA this phone is not compatible with most 4g/LTE networks. I am using Tmobile and the voice/text work excellent, but for my data connection I fluctuate from EDGE (2g) most the time, to HSPA+ in ""TOWN"". I live on the big island of Hawaii, so that probably has a lot to do with it, because I know in some major cities such as Honolulu, LA, Seattle, etc...people using this phone are getting HSPA+ consistently. I called ATT to check the compatibility of this phone and apparently you can get 4g with it.All in all, this is a killer phone - comes brand new and sealed in the box with all paperwork and accessories. It is European so it comes with the european wall type outlet plugs, with an adapter for US plugs. And the shipping was very fast at around 3 business days (I paid extra shipping costs). I just wanted to let people know to do their research and check the compatibility with their cell phone carrier. I personally am not some kind of ""power user"" - so being in 2g sometimes doesnt bother me. But I know there are people out there who have to be in 4g conditions 100% of the time, and if you are one of those people - I would reconsider buying this international model and get one straight from your carrier or samsung.",17

I had an iphone 4 before this and was looking for another small phone (women's pockets and hands are not growing with the trend in phone size). It is a size up from the iphone but not drastic and it's definitely lighter. My bf has the regular s4 and he's even a little jealous of the size. Going from ios to android was also a plus. As far as specs go it is a great display, clear picture taking and interface. It did initially come in italian but that's no surprise and you can uninstall or hide the silly preinstalled apps it comes with. No problems or changes in AT&T service- I simply moved my sim card over. My messaging app does freeze from time to time but it may be that I have thousands of messages I haven't deleted.In general, I don't ask a whole lot from my phone: pictures, a couple internet tabs, sms, a couple phone calls a week. I also had an outdated phone so for me this was more than I could ask for.",3

Samsung Korea SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 MINI GT-i9195 LTE 8GB- FACTORY UNLOCKED International Version - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - White(NO WARRANTY),Samsung,379,5,"I purchased this unlocked phone because I did not want to feel obligated to stay with a specific mobile phone company. When I purchased this phone the first thing that I noticed was high light and sleek it was. This phone fits perfectly in my purse and does not take up a lot of space. It is white and the quality is excellent. I chose to use ATT as my provider and had to go into the store for a SIM card. Here are few tips for you after purchasing the phone:1) Go into your local mobile carrier store to request a SIM card2) Some of the customer services reps are inexperienced with unlocked phones. As a result, do not accept that they do not have a SIM card for the phone. Ask to speak to someone who is experienced with unlocked phones.3) You will know whether or not the phone works before even leaving the store. I was able to dial out immediately.To protect my investment, I brought a protective case for the phone on Amazon too. Attached is a photo of the phone with the case on it.",

"Samsung Mythic A897 Unlocked Phone with Touch Screen, 3.2 MP Camera and 3G Support - US Warranty - Black",Samsung,19.88,1,This phone came in promptly. It worked for 10 days and the touchscreen became unresponsive. I tried taking the battery out for a few minutes several times. I did not drop this phone or get it wet or anything unusual. I did contact the seller and they said they didn't know what I was doing with the phone for 10 days. I could not RESET the phone because the touchscreen would not work. I am very disappointed and will not ever buy from this seller again or recommend them. The restocking fee for this phone was as much as I paid for it so it's not worth sending it back for a refund....it would end up costing me more than I spent in the first place. At least I would've expected the seller to try and help fix the problem or offer to replace it. Lesson learned! This is my first negative experience with an AMAZON seller.,0

"Samsung Mythic A897 Unlocked Phone with Touch Screen, 3.2 MP Camera and 3G Support - US Warranty - Black",Samsung,19.88,2,"Touchscreen is terrible. You need to press the screen really hard to get the 'correct' thing done. Otherwise, it will stay dumb! I used to have iPhone before for 2 years, and I got this one only to get rid of dataplan (as I was not using dataplan much). This phone doesn't need to have dataplan and that's the only good thing about this phone.Other things like crystal clear home screens which change every time the phone is in locked position, makes it look something interesting. But that is not any convenient feature I was looking for!I had hard time in adding contacts or notes. Searching contacts by scrolling is very challenging and you need to get used to some 'special skills'.Overall, I am going to use this only to make calls and nothing else. This phone is not good at all for texting or even surfing internet (If you take 3G plan, you can use internet in this phone). Browsing is something terrible to do in this phone.If you are looking for browsing (3G) feature along with calling and texting, this is not a good phone.I am using it only for voice calls and I am going to dump it in future.",0
"Samsung Mythic A897 Unlocked Phone with Touch Screen, 3.2 MP Camera and 3G Support - US Warranty - Black",Samsung,19.88,3,"I bought a Samsung Mythic as an upgrade to my Samsung Eternity. I'm glad I kept the Eternity as it is a better phone in all respects. I recently switched my AT@T Sim card back to the Eternity and couldn't be happier. The only thing lacking on the Eternity is speed dialing which I can get along without. See other reviews on the Mythic to understand the undesirable bugs that have to be dealt with in everyday use of the Mythic. Below is my previous review of the Eternity, old reliable. Not sure if you can find one of them anymore, but would certainly be worth a search if you are in the market for one of the better feature phones ever made.The wife and I obtained two of these Samsung Eternity cell phones brand new on an AT@T contract over 5 years ago. They have been one of the better investments we have ever made. Mine is still rock solid. Hers finally died; probably from old age and constant use. We have tried other phones before and since with none of them comparing to the Eternity. Keep in mind that we have no desire for smartphone technology or use. This is probably one of the better basic cell phones out there. It is the right size, wonderful touch screen, great ergonomics, with wonderful clarity coming and going. The 3 meg camera produces astonishingly good photos. I can only attribute that to what must be an above average lens. Everything works correctly for our purposes. I really like the way I get the large QWERTY virtual keyboard when I turn the phone horizontally for texting. I do find it somewhat difficult to text on any touch screen, but find that this one works better than most. It has that slight vibration feedback on every key stroke. It fits quite well in a belt case. About the only negative I have is that the speaker phone can produce some distortion especially if the volume is turned up too loud. Every time we think about upgrading to smartphones we decline because of the overpriced data charges, larger size, and complexity. Besides, we would rather use a second device with a larger screen such as our Samsung tablets for wi-fi internet away from home. We are even thinking about purchasing two more Eternities used or refurbished to hold in reserve. They are that good.",0

The phone runs android 2.3 so be aware that it is not the lastest android version and it is not clear it will be released with sandwich. The call quality is excellent. The internet speed on AT&T is also great as it uses the real 4G (LTE) network features. The system comes with the standard Samsung application package, it is entirely OK, but I am not too crazy about their calendar app. The phone has pretty good overall performance. The GPS tracking for google map, yelp, ... is slow acquiring a satellite fix (5-10 times slower than iPhone). The big screen is excellent for email reading/web browsing. However the big screen does imply that it barely fits in one hand and for example for running using Run Keeper or a similar application, it is really too large.

"Samsung N920 Unlocked Galaxy Note 5, GSM 32GB Gold Factory - International Version (Gold)",Samsung,561.5,1,"For the sake of total disclosure, the Note 5 is a five-star phone in every way. This review is for those clinical level investigators that begin their research with one-star reviews, to expose any weaknesses of a product. That said, I have transitioned from a Galaxy S3 to the Note 5. The Note 5 is more intuitive, faster, and offered the least painful transition from an existing phone, with the ‚ÄúSamsung Switch‚Äù app. I would sincerely encourage the reader to get a protective case for the phone. The Note 5 is NOT indestructible. Its been over a month since I activated (and case protected) my Note 5, and I could not be more satisfied with this Samsung product. A word of caution though, this phone will NOT work on the Sprint cellular network. I found this out the hard way. Just because it‚Äôs ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù does not make it adaptable to any network. T-Mobile helped this ‚Äúdoubting Thomas‚Äù to understand that, and redeem an otherwise costly mistake.P.S. The Vendor: Open Group Wireless is awesome!

"Samsung N920 Unlocked Galaxy Note 5, GSM 32GB Gold Factory - International Version (Gold)",Samsung,561.5,3,"In theory I love this phone. The functionality, the set up, the ease of use. I do. I love it. The stylus for note taking is a particular favorite feature for a nerd like me- I can jot down a note without looking at a keyboard or opening an app- super handy in dark rooms while listening to nerds(said with love) talk about stuff.However this version isn't awesome. Not realizing I was purchasing an international version for use in the US was my fault- admittedly. There is a US adapter for the European plug that comes with the phone, which is handy. If I do travel internationally in the next little while it'll be handy to not need to worry about the converter I guess.Except for the fact that I never have service anywhere. The phone just can't manage to have more than two measly bars of service at most- and even then doesn't always actually send calls through. After digging through the specifications deeper today (after purchasing several months ago) I realized that even though it says it services T Mobile- it doesn't actually fully support T Mobile. I'm guessing this is the issue. Because my kid with a different phone than me has no issue with service when in the same location.I wouldn't even notice if I could connect to wifi calling- but I can't. There is no option, not for this version. Even better? The phone has a sense of when a call is super important... and that's when it decides it doesn't have enough connectivity to ring through. I'm not sure what sort of voodoo that is, but it's frustrating as all hell. Client call? Straight to voicemail. Kid puking their guts out AND have a broken arm at school (rough recess right?) Straight to voicemail. Text from that super cute guy I was hoping to see? That comes through... but only after enough delay that the order of texts mess up my clearly clever intent and now just make me look like a dork. (To be fair it doesn't take too much voodoo for that.)I do somehow manage to get every sales call though. Yup. Voodoo.I don't know if there is a fix to this. Maybe it's just the universe telling me to move to Belgium (how does this model perform in Belgium? No idea, but it's got to be better than here.)So- if you have T Mobile? Don't buy this phone.",3

"Samsung N920 Unlocked Galaxy Note 5, GSM 32GB Gold Factory - International Version (Gold)",Samsung,561.5,1,"I purchased this phone before I read the reviews on it and I must say that it was disappointing to hear of the three major deductions made in this model. Namely the non removable battery, the removal of the remote control feature and the removal of the SD card slot.I have not had this phone a full year as yet and I'm already experiencing major problems. Firstly the s-pen started to give me a ghost movement in that it began to select items while it was about a half inch over the screen. This made my playing games like clash of clans difficult to nearly impossible, to the point where I stopped playing with the pen.I have also been experiencing problems with the battery and charging in that even though I'm using the original adaptive fast charger the phone will not fast charge. At first unplugging and reconnecting the charger cord a couple time would solve the problem but now it doesn't work at all. Today was the last straw as I watched my phone drop from 35% to 0% in one minute. Almost every two seconds it would lose 1%. I plugged it in to charge but it kept dropping till it just went off completely. I then left it to charge for an hour and it had only reached 14%. As I turned it back on it started dropping again and went off with the cord still plugged in. I love my Notes as I previously owned the Note 2 and 4 (the latter was stolen) and both worked beautifully.My advice DON'T even think about buying this phone. Either wait for the Note 6 and hope for the best or get the Note 4 which is the best in my eyes.",4

"Samsung N920 Unlocked Galaxy Note 5, GSM 32GB Gold Factory - International Version (Gold)",Samsung,561.5,5,"1 Best phone in the market right now.2 Cons Why everyone picking on samsung I phones never had removable batteries or micro sd expansion.3 They are not the 1st to make a phone with a glass back or with glass overall all phones have glass screens so if you don't want to damage your 750 dollar phone pick up a 15 dollar case and a 10 dollar tempered glass screen protector.4. Samsung is a company yes. They are in Business to make money right not for people to like them or make friends they have demographics that they work out to know what individuals like. It does work because they are number one cellular phone manufacturer by volume globally, however not in the USA or China, Apple is because Americans typically like apple so to become number 1 in the largest market in the world you have to be Apple and be better than apple, that's what they are doing that's not exactly a bad thing.5. Global policy makers are having companies move towards technologies such as cloud storage, biometrics, and always on cellular devices on each person thats where Global policies are now I dont agree with it but it is what it is.6. The phone is a well constructed beautifully engineered device it is fast elegant and powerful, its full of features simple and can be pretty much anything you want it to be software wise if u need 1 home screen and 1 app screen with 10 apps you can do that if you need 7 or more home screens and a lot of apps you can do that as well.7. This phone is not for everyone, if enough people don't like it vote with your dollars and it may change.8. I Personally love the device its quick full of specs ans charges from 0 to 100 in around an hour and 20 mins gives me around 4 and a half hours to 5 and a half hours of screen on time or around a day on a half I am not big into apps and all that most of the apps I use are already pre installed in big into media consumption chrome-casting to my TV and all that.9. This phone is not perfect to me either i believe Samsung could have built in a micro SD slot along with the sim card slot, include an IR blaster and that S6 edge+ if it was a Note 5 Edge i would have been reviewing a different phone today. A Note 5 edge with IR blaster and micro SD expansion would have been my perfect phone.10. The battery is 3000 MAh and is greatly optimized to provide better battery life.11. It has 4 Gb of DDR4 Ram a lot of laptops don't have that and trust me it works it pushes through this beautiful Super Amoled 2K screen like it wasn't even there.It is a beast its over priced 550 to 600 is what i would value it at for a phone Im only gonna keep for a year i still payed 750 for it though still not 100% sure why guess I was feeling kinda ball-ish but when I buy a phone like this personally its for 70% emotional reason and 30% piratical because its really and truly dollar for dollar not worth it especially when it can fall into a gutter or pool of water n be toasted and ma weeks pay is gone just like that.12. All these people leaving negative reviews um did you read the specifications and then make your purchase because complaining about the phone doesn't have a micro SD expansion and replaceable battery is like buying a Mercedes Benz and complaining that it doesn't have a flat bed :/ and frankly I wouldn't take a review from a person that doesn't read what hes about to dish out 750 bucks about serious its as thou your an impulse buyer.13. This is the best phone in the market right now I am a note user i love the big screen the multitasking features and powerful specs samsung galaxy notes come with I've had the note 1 the note 3 and now the note 5 and have never no regrets yet as I said before its not perfect my perfect phone is a galaxy note 5 edge with a micro SD expansion slot and an IR blaster but I love using the S pen in class as im a student to do maths take notes and remind my classmates that they are minions with their HTC and Iphone.",46

You are ACTUALLY buying ""international"" smartphone. It is a no joke. I wouldn't say it is a recommended for Americans.I just obtained and it went so perfectly functionally well. BUT... the problem is if you are living in USA, and you are looking for the USA version phone. I will say that you should NOT buy it. So as my phone's version is United Arab Emirates. @_@Don't look at me because it is a sale.UPDATE 4/15: I understand what the international products for. So, it is definitely not for everyone. The real three stars will remain same, but I write as a 5-stars rate since I obtained the phone as working functionally well. I will see the more for few days if it is still good or not.If you want to get USA phone safety, then you have to purchase your local in-store or official websites (such Verizon) only instead Amazon online.",1

I hate the useless clicker aspect to the stylus. All it does is allows you to remove it from the phone's body.

"Samsung N920 Unlocked Galaxy Note 5, GSM 32GB Gold Factory - International Version (Gold)",Samsung,561.5,4,"I love the device, but I hated the seller. It's advertised as ""factory unlocked,"" which, according to the seller, means ""international,"" which, according to the seller, is equivalent to having features specific to United Arab Emirates. What that means is that Ramadan will be on your calendar for 4 weeks in the summer, and there's nothing you can do to get rid of it. No other holidays are pre-loaded into the calendar--just that one Muslim one. Also, the charger I got was not for U.S. outlets, and they sent a crappy black adapter with it. (After going back and forth to no avail with the seller, and to little effect with Amazon, I was directed to contact Samsung for a user manual and for instructions to fix the calendar problem. Haven't had time to mess with that yet, so I can't say if they'll be able to solve the problem. Amazon sent me a U.S. charger that matched the phone.) Other than that, I love the device. The big screen and S-Pen appeal to my middle-aged eyes and somewhat old fashioned sensibilities. (I like to write with pens). And it's really convenient to be able to jot things down and easily look them up or add to contacts later, etc. I'm far from an expert with smart phones (this is my first one) so I'll let others give you more technical run-down on the phone. I'm very happy with the device.",3

CONS: I do have to say that in lowlight indoors, this phone takes some pretty s*** pictures. But that's to be expected, and I'm sure the iPhone wouldn't perform better. Also, this phone is huge. It's a pro and a con. I honestly wouldn't mind at all, but I'm a woman with fairly small hands and sometimes I have trouble holding it in one hand.

"Samsung N920 Unlocked Galaxy Note 5, GSM 32GB Gold Factory - International Version (Gold)",Samsung,561.5,5,"I split my world between north America and Australia, so I wanted a device that would work in both countries. I purchased the unlocked Samsung Galaxy Note 5 to replace my original Note device (it held up well for 5 years). This device is called an""international device"" but you need to look at the specific countries in the international listing to make sure it works where you want it to. You need the specific device details, and can type ""will my phone work"" into your web browser to find sites that will help you determine if it will work.The Note 5 arrived quickly and in good shape. It did have fingerprints on it, which made me a little nervous, but when turned on showed no signs of being a previously used device. This device comes with an Australian adapter, which is exactly what I wanted, for travel in Australia. You wil have to purchase your own US adapter, or use an adapter from a previous compatible phone if you are purchasing to use in the US. I already had my adapters from my original Note, those adapters work seamlessly with the Note 5. Some of the pre-loaded apps will also differ from the US locked version, so you will have to take some time to download them from the Play Store. So far all desired apps have been easy to find and to load.This is the gold version of the phone. I don't care so much about color because it is covered by the case. This screen of this phone seems to get dirty fast, so I will probably apply a protective shield because I can't stand the buildup. Like others, I miss having the ability to switch out additional storage cards, but as the world seems to be moving toward the cloud in all digital matters, I think my opinion here may change over time, too. I have had NO problems with the stylus. My case must protect it enough that it doesn't accidentally get bumped out.Battery life is insane. I go 3-4 days before recharging and have yet to find myself at a critical low battery level. I love the encryption option, and yes, I turned mine on. The phone itself is very lightweight, but I have not had any problems losing grip or slipping. Overall, I am incredibly pleased with the purchase and grateful for a product that will keep me loyal to the Galaxy Note line.",0

I can also use data while in a call, despite someone saying they couldn't. No issues whatsoever, have had the phone for a month or so. I'm waiting for the pen to break, but I don't use it that often (except now, to write this review). This is the international version so Samsung Pay and Microsoft Office don't work, but I wouldn't use them anyway, so it does everything I need.Battery life is great for my usage level of probably no more than an hour or two a day.

"Samsung N920 Unlocked Galaxy Note 5, GSM 32GB Gold Factory - International Version (Gold)",Samsung,561.5,5,"I upgraded from a Note 4 and the Note 5 is beautiful. I used to have the color white, so I purchased the gold. I am not a techy person so I wont go too much into detail. The only negative things I have to say about the Note 5 is the obvious lack of expandable storage and removable battery, but Samsung announced they will be bringing it back. However, I am okay with the storage amount on this device.I was a little nervous about purchasing a phone on Amazon, especially an international version. I was not sure of the difference but I do not notice anything. Everything arrived safely and on time. The phone arrived in an original Samsung box with the Samsung headphones and a UK style Samsung wall adapter. I was concerned over this, but after double-checking the box, the seller supplied me with a U.S. adapter. This was awesome because my phone still recognized it was a fast travel charger, even with the adapter. I used to have a TMobile Note 4 with a StraightTalk micro sim. The Note 5 is nano size, so I had to purchase a new one. Transferring my number was an easy process that only lasted a few hours, which is normal. The SM-N920C (Note 5) is 4G LTE capable. I was panicking at first because it only said 4G on the status bar, but it is just cosmetic. It is 4G LTE, but it says 4G. The phone is fast with and without wifi.I love the Galaxy Note models because of the S Pen. On the Note 4, you just pull the S Pen out but on this model, you have to push it in to get it out. It is a little new for me, but it is not something I cant get used to. The functionality of the S Pen is excellent. It also looks really nice.There is no lagging on the Note 5. Everything processes smoothly. I am such a big fan of Samsung and I am amazed by all of the things this device can do. I am a college student and it just helps me with my daily tasks and I also love to stream videos and music. I can tell you the Note 5 screen looks way better on the Note 5 than the Note 4. The Note 4 is a great phone, but if you have the chance to upgrade, do it!I know most of my review was a comparison between Note 4 and 5 but I was trying to give as much detail as possible :) comment if you have any questions.",17

"Samsung N920 Unlocked Galaxy Note 5, GSM 32GB Gold Factory - International Version (Gold)",Samsung,561.5,1,"I purchased this phone before I read the reviews on it and I must say that it was disappointing to hear of the three major deductions made in this model. Namely the non removable battery, the removal of the remote control feature and the removal of the SD card slot.I have not had this phone a full year as yet and I'm already experiencing major problems. Firstly the s-pen started to give me a ghost movement in that it began to select items while it was about a half inch over the screen. This made my playing games like clash of clans difficult to nearly impossible, to the point where I stopped playing with the pen.I have also been experiencing problems with the battery and charging in that even though I'm using the original adaptive fast charger the phone will not fast charge. At first unplugging and reconnecting the charger cord a couple time would solve the problem but now it doesn't work at all. Today was the last straw as I watched my phone drop from 35% to 0% in one minute. Almost every two seconds it would lose 1%. I plugged it in to charge but it kept dropping till it just went off completely. I then left it to charge for an hour and it had only reached 14%. As I turned it back on it started dropping again and went off with the cord still plugged in. I love my Notes as I previously owned the Note 2 and 4 (the latter was stolen) and both worked beautifully.My advice DON'T even think about buying this phone. Either wait for the Note 6 and hope for the best or get the Note 4 which is the best in my eyes.",4

Samsung Note 2 I317 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Phone - Titanium Silver,Samsung,109.99,4,"Okay, so the Samsung Galaxy Note II is obviously a great phone, and as I feel that reviews of this nature should focus more on the seller, I won't discuss how amazing this phone is, in and of itself. This phone is roughly $800 from AT&T, Verizon, and Amazon out-of-contract. The seller listing the product here is selling it for $300 less than anyone else and it's not used or refurbished. That is pretty spectacular. However, the battery that came with this phone is next to useless. It has no brand name marked on it and just says Made In China. The life of the battery is terrible. I literally have to leave my phone plugged into the wall at all times. If I unplug it, the battery drains waaaay too quickly. My friend has this phone and his battery is not even close to as bad as mine. He bought his phone from Verizon and it came with a battery that, while it looks similar in marking and color to mine, it says Samsung across it. Mine does not. His charger is also completely different. It's very likely that my charger is a fake too, although the piece that plugs into the outlet says Samsung on it, it is not the stock charger that comes with the phone. The phone, battery, and charger came in a plain AT&T box that was not sealed, although it was shrinkwrapped. Part of the box had been torn and patched with scotch tape. It came with the appropriate manual. Fortunately, despite all of this, the phone itself is 100% legitimate and works perfectly. I will be forced to purchase a real battery for $20 or so and I will probably invest in a new charger at a later time, but this doesn't really bother me a lot. It irks me, slightly, that the seller felt the need to sell the phone with a s***ty battery, but honestly, a battery and the actual Samsung Note II box is NOT worth $300 extra dollars to me. If you need to buy this phone out of contract, then I would recommend purchasing it from this seller even though their choice of sending it with a fake battery is questionable, you'll still come out ahead purchasing this phone here and a new battery from somewhere else. I'm still relatively happy with my purchase. Perhaps the seller should notify that this device ships with a third-party battery instead of the OEM Samsung battery, but it's not a HUGE deal. If you want this phone new, get it here unless you want to pay $300 for a nice box and a battery. If you're okay with a used phone, then I recommend you go to Swappa and look there. I don't like buying used electronics like this, however.",50
Samsung Note 2 I317 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Phone - Titanium Silver,Samsung,109.99,5,"Phone arrived as scheduled apparently undamaged. The box was a plain box labeled ""AT&T"" but not a new retail AT&T box. There was no, absolutely no, paperwork in the box just the phone, the battery, the wall charger, a usb cable and a set of Samsung earbuds. The phone is a wonderful piece of electronics and the Android OS is easy to learn and use. I had to get a new sim, my old one was a full size and the Note 2 uses a mini. The phone was instantly recognized by the AT&T system and picked up both a cell and data signal. The problem that I am having is with the usb connection. It is apparently defective. I can charge the battery, but only consistently if the phone is off. I have only been able to connect with my computer once, and that was a struggle. I have contacted Samsung and they have assured me that the phone is under warranty should I need to get it repaired but that requires sending the phone in and having to pay to ship it there and being without it for who knows how long. As this is a ""new"" phone and an expensive phone one would expect that it would not need to be repaired upon arrival. I have not contacted the seller yet as I am still trying to see if the problem is software or hardware related.Pros:Beautiful screenFast processorResponsive OSActually good battery life (when I can get it charged)Cons:AT&T crapware that is unremovable (this on top of the OS and Samsung's software left a little over 10 gig out of the base 16 gig usable)the usb connection problem that I am havingI would still recommend this phone to anyone that needs the screen size and does not mind the fact that it is a big phone.UPDATE 5/3/13:The problem with the USB port was resolved by resetting the phone to factory default (had to download the manual from Samsung for directions). The problem did let me find out 2 things: 1 - the seller was quick to offer an exchange if necessary, good communication response and helpful and 2 - the phone is covered by a Samsung 1 year warranty, you do have to register the phone for warranty support.",31

I ordered this phone which was listed similarly...a small note from the seller indicated that it was an i317M. That is the designation for a canadian phone. They are completely unbranded...The nice thing is that it indeed works on AT&T's LTE frequencies. The only thing that you'll need to do is set the apn up yourself...just inserting the sim sets up at&t's old apn settings...you'll need to change them to get lte speeds...Other than that, you get to enjoy a phone with none of the at&t bloatware, and no restrictions in the software...it's fantastic.Mark",8

Samsung Note 2 I317 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Phone - Titanium Silver,Samsung,109.99,2,"I was pretty excited when this got in the mail that I actually was a few minutes late for work when I waited for the mail to be delivered at my apartment. I opened up the box and I was greeted with a slick Galaxy Note 2 with a ""Do not text and drive"" film on the screen. I quickly took the SIM card and SDcard out of my old phone (Moto E) and popped them into the Note 2. I booted up the Note 2 and it started with the typical Samsung splash, then a...T-Mobile animation? I thought this was an AT&T unlocked phone, not that it mattered since I was using T-Mobile anyways.After the Note 2 finished booting up, it started the first run procedure of asking the language, setting up the Wifi...oh wait, I can't. For some reason, every time I try to turn on the Wifi, it switches back off; same goes for the Bluetooth. At first, I was just more excited to get this phone working with 4G LTE since the Moto E I got doesn't support 4G, but then I noticed another issue: I had either hardly or no data or voice connection. Sometimes it won't even get registered to T-Mobile's network. I did some reading around on forums about the Wifi/Bluetooth issue and I found out that some of these Note 2s actually have faulty Wifi/Bluetooth antennas. Same could be said for the poor network connections with T-Mobile.I have already contacted the seller that I bought it from, but I won't hear back from them until the weekdays. I'll update once I can set up a replacement. As of right now, I'm very dissatisfied. Shame on you, Samsung. You're really making me want to get the Lenovo K3 Note even more now...",0

Samsung Note 2 I317 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Phone - Titanium Silver,Samsung,109.99,4,"Okay, so the Samsung Galaxy Note II is obviously a great phone, and as I feel that reviews of this nature should focus more on the seller, I won't discuss how amazing this phone is, in and of itself. This phone is roughly $800 from AT&T, Verizon, and Amazon out-of-contract. The seller listing the product here is selling it for $300 less than anyone else and it's not used or refurbished. That is pretty spectacular. However, the battery that came with this phone is next to useless. It has no brand name marked on it and just says Made In China. The life of the battery is terrible. I literally have to leave my phone plugged into the wall at all times. If I unplug it, the battery drains waaaay too quickly. My friend has this phone and his battery is not even close to as bad as mine. He bought his phone from Verizon and it came with a battery that, while it looks similar in marking and color to mine, it says Samsung across it. Mine does not. His charger is also completely different. It's very likely that my charger is a fake too, although the piece that plugs into the outlet says Samsung on it, it is not the stock charger that comes with the phone. The phone, battery, and charger came in a plain AT&T box that was not sealed, although it was shrinkwrapped. Part of the box had been torn and patched with scotch tape. It came with the appropriate manual. Fortunately, despite all of this, the phone itself is 100% legitimate and works perfectly. I will be forced to purchase a real battery for $20 or so and I will probably invest in a new charger at a later time, but this doesn't really bother me a lot. It irks me, slightly, that the seller felt the need to sell the phone with a s***ty battery, but honestly, a battery and the actual Samsung Note II box is NOT worth $300 extra dollars to me. If you need to buy this phone out of contract, then I would recommend purchasing it from this seller even though their choice of sending it with a fake battery is questionable, you'll still come out ahead purchasing this phone here and a new battery from somewhere else. I'm still relatively happy with my purchase. Perhaps the seller should notify that this device ships with a third-party battery instead of the OEM Samsung battery, but it's not a HUGE deal. If you want this phone new, get it here unless you want to pay $300 for a nice box and a battery. If you're okay with a used phone, then I recommend you go to Swappa and look there. I don't like buying used electronics like this, however.",50
Samsung Note 2 I317 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Phone - Titanium Silver,Samsung,109.99,5,"Phone arrived as scheduled apparently undamaged. The box was a plain box labeled ""AT&T"" but not a new retail AT&T box. There was no, absolutely no, paperwork in the box just the phone, the battery, the wall charger, a usb cable and a set of Samsung earbuds. The phone is a wonderful piece of electronics and the Android OS is easy to learn and use. I had to get a new sim, my old one was a full size and the Note 2 uses a mini. The phone was instantly recognized by the AT&T system and picked up both a cell and data signal. The problem that I am having is with the usb connection. It is apparently defective. I can charge the battery, but only consistently if the phone is off. I have only been able to connect with my computer once, and that was a struggle. I have contacted Samsung and they have assured me that the phone is under warranty should I need to get it repaired but that requires sending the phone in and having to pay to ship it there and being without it for who knows how long. As this is a ""new"" phone and an expensive phone one would expect that it would not need to be repaired upon arrival. I have not contacted the seller yet as I am still trying to see if the problem is software or hardware related.Pros:Beautiful screenFast processorResponsive OSActually good battery life (when I can get it charged)Cons:AT&T crapware that is unremovable (this on top of the OS and Samsung's software left a little over 10 gig out of the base 16 gig usable)the usb connection problem that I am havingI would still recommend this phone to anyone that needs the screen size and does not mind the fact that it is a big phone.UPDATE 5/3/13:The problem with the USB port was resolved by resetting the phone to factory default (had to download the manual from Samsung for directions). The problem did let me find out 2 things: 1 - the seller was quick to offer an exchange if necessary, good communication response and helpful and 2 - the phone is covered by a Samsung 1 year warranty, you do have to register the phone for warranty support.",31
Samsung Note 2 I317 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Phone - Titanium Silver,Samsung,109.99,5,"Everyone has left opinions on this phone. I ordered this phone which was listed similarly...a small note from the seller indicated that it was an i317M. That is the designation for a canadian phone. They are completely unbranded...The nice thing is that it indeed works on AT&T's LTE frequencies. The only thing that you'll need to do is set the apn up yourself...just inserting the sim sets up at&t's old apn settings...you'll need to change them to get lte speeds...Other than that, you get to enjoy a phone with none of the at&t bloatware, and no restrictions in the software...it's fantastic.Mark",8

Samsung Note 2 I317 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Phone - Titanium Silver,Samsung,109.99,4,"Just got the phone in the mail, i took it out and immediatly noticed the box. The box was opened , not sealed by any means of the word, as the phone could just fall right out, it was also torn and ripped in some places, the packing list paper inside was also crumpled up and torn, i can look beyond the boxing though but it just concerns me about everything else, if the box is in this condition what else might be wrong? The phone itself is in perfect condition except for one little spot where the back doesnt fit on all the way but i dont care much, so i will see how this phone pans out over the next few weekasand i will try to update.",0

Samsung Note 2 I317 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Phone - Titanium Silver,Samsung,109.99,5,The best android ive owned. Ive been a winmo guy since the early 2000s and vowed to never go android. Got tired of windows freezing and locking. My first android was a Dell Streak and LOVED IT. Had three of them until finally had to lay them to rest when Dell DROPPED THE BALL AT THE START GATE. This was the PERFECT replacement and whips the streak NEKKID! Galaxy Note 2 does everything i need and more. Like a mini computer!,
Samsung Note 2 I317 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Phone - Titanium Silver,Samsung,109.99,2,"Purchased this phone 1st week of June. I worked beautifully till August 26, almost 90 days when the screen started to blur, move and change color. It worked one day with the stylus although blurry. The next day the screen went black but the home button and back button worked, the light at the top showed it was on. Samsung will not help, their website doesn't recognize this phone, their tech support could only narrow the country of origin down to India, Phillipines, Ireland or UK and only had phone numbers for three of the four countries! Apparently it is my job to attempt to find the correct country and then get service according to Samsung. I've emailed three countries with no reply yet ...by the way you find other countries sites by clicking the tiny flag on the bottom of the main US website.Using the really awsome help of my brother's research, we determined the issue was probably the screen flex cable, (due to the stylus worked for a day so the digitizer was probably working), I used the also awesome youtube repair video by Le55ons (thanks!) and took apart my Note 2 and found the flex cable for the screen was covered in corrosion. This is not water damage, it is inside and there is no evidence of damage anywhere but on the pins when I separated them. I cleaned them with a dry tooth brush and put it back together; the screen turned on several times but is still flickering and having connectivity issues. I can't find flex cables for the screen to purchase and a complete digitizer setup costs $250 plus shipping, more than a Google Nexus 4 $199. currently.Next stop Google, if you check corrosion Note 2 you'll find pages and pages of recent consumer complaints about Samsung corrosion issues, often caused by faulty electronic connections according to some posts, and a complete lack of customer service as I experienced.I'll buy a Google phone next, they'll at least have a decent website and someone to communicate with if I have an issue.Rant:Samsung, I know you are so popular in Asia and Europe that you don't care about my customer service but this is partly why Apple is still King in the US since we have to pay so much for the product here and risk crappy to zero support, unless you pay for insurance, which is a ripoff if the phone works as intended. I won't buy Samsung again if I can find another suitable product, and certainly not without waiting for and doing really careful research on consumer reports.",4
Samsung Note 2 I317 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Phone - Titanium Silver,Samsung,109.99,5,"Just got this phone and its AWESOME!

Samsung Note 2 I317 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Phone - Titanium Silver,Samsung,109.99,5,"I bought a used Note 2 to replace my Lumia 1520 because I couldn't stand the fact that Microsoft was providing updates for the Android and iOS apps (Office, Skype, OneDrive) before supporting their own platform.It's a solid device, it runs pretty much everything I throw at it currently. I wound up installing Ditto Note 3 with the ANGI Kernel in order to help solve my only issue - battery life. it's abysmal and I was recharging before noon at my desk. The new kernel and a ZeroLemon 9300mah battery later, and I can go 20 hours and still be at 65%. Definitely worth dropping the extra $45 if you don't want to be tied to the wall all the time. DN3 is worth an install too - the Note 3 features like Air Command are great.I like touchwiz, it's come a loooong way from android 1.6 devices, and will be sticking with Galaxy Notes for the forseeable future.",0

Samsung Note 2 I317 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Phone - White (International Version),Samsung,159.95,5,just couldn't be happier with product as advertized,1
Samsung Note 2 I317 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Phone - White (International Version),Samsung,159.95,5,I ordered this new from the seller wireless experts Inc. First of all it came a day early which was pretty awesome! The phone was in its original packaging with everything in it. Brand new battery and everything. The one I received is an AT&T phone (but that's exactly what I wanted in the first place). All I had to do was switch my SIM card over. It works perfectly and I absolutely love the size. Just be sure to do all of the system updates when you get it... since the model is a couple years old it won't be running on the current version of Android. I highly recommend this phone to anyone who is tired of small phones! Thanks wireless experts for sending me a perfect phone!,1

Samsung Note 2 I317 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Phone - White (International Version),Samsung,159.95,4,"The phone looks new, but the packaging it came in was a really bad. It was torn from one side which made me think that it could be stolen or something. So I went ahead and checked the EMEI, but did not find it in blacklisted IMEI's so I guess I was just being paranoid.I think the phone is a bit bulky and I personally do not prefer such a big phone in my hands. But it was for my cousin and she wanted this one so I got it for her.",0
Samsung Note 2 I317 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Phone - White (International Version),Samsung,159.95,5,"Phone is beautiful and big. Totally unlocked, I activated it with straight talk and it works awesome. No hassle at all. Love it! Highly recommend to anyone.",13
Samsung Note 2 I317 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Phone - White (International Version),Samsung,159.95,5,"I was a bit wary, based on some reviews, about buying this phone. Now, I am happy to say, it was a good decision.Before I spout about how much I love this phone, a few things need to be mentioned:1) This phone comes NEW (unless you buy it from a seller other than the one above)2) This phone needs to be unlocked with a CODE that is PROVIDED by the seller and is on a sticker on the side of the phone box. It is a very easy process...I took a pic but scribbled out the code in Paper Artist before uploading, so it is a bit artsy (didn't feel like downloading a photo editing app - for some reason, it didn't come with one).3) If you are using Straight Talk, you won't need to unlock it.4) I am writing this review in my own handwriting and it is converting it to text!! Pic added for emphasis. NOTE: You can take a screenshot and write on it (hold down the button on the stylus and touch pen to screen for a couple seconds), but you have to download an app to scribble on photos, I guess.5) Downloading the manual and taking time to read through all the features is HIGHLY recommended. There are tons that most people never use.6) Most people will not need all the features this phone has to offer. It is a phone that works. And by work I mean multi-task and simplify all your tasks for business and/or school.That being said, I am a student of Graphic and Web Design and I have a few projects for businesses I am working on. I have been wanting a tablet that I can draw, sketch ideas, and take notes with, but haven't found one reasonably priced (I have a pretty small budget) that could accomplish what I needed.In other news, I wanted a new phone badly. My iPhone 4 was worthless for what I wanted/needed for school and work. I killed two birds with one stone by getting this phone!I have nothing but praise for the S Pen. Amazingly accurate and looks like my own handwriting, which is something I have only seen in a Microsoft Surface Pro. Must be that Wacom technology. The stylus is superior even to my Wacom Bamboo stylus! I have already sketched out some ideas for a new website and the possibilities for school and work efficiency are endless with this thing. My calendars were synced, emails, google drive, etc. Makes it easier than checking all that stuff from my laptop.I won't bother with specs, those have been covered in other reviews.Battery life: the more you have going on, the more battery you use. Sorry.Overall, a money-saving purchase for someone who wants a small tablet and a phone but can only afford one and doesn't want to carry both around.Win-Win!",1

Samsung Note 2 I317 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Phone - White (International Version),Samsung,159.95,1,"I hate this phone with a passion. I don't think the problem is from the phone but from the sellers. I used this type of phone in the past and I loved it. I broke the screen and decided to get the same type but it was a total disappointment. I ordered the phone from these sellers and it came faulty: it didn't come on for more than a day, and when it did, the it couldn't work with any headphones. I returned the phone and wanted a replacement, it took almost a month to get the a new phone back. They really have bad customer service, it is terrible. The new phone is super terrible; the wifi use to work about 3days in the week, and that will even connect by restarting the phone. I was thinking it was temporal and I didn't want to go through the hustle with these sellers, so I didn't return it. Unfortunately, the wifi is permanently off now. It doesn't detect any wifi anywhere I go. The battery that came with the second phone was generic, it couldn't even go 4hrs. I had to use the battery from my old broken screen-phone.I wouldn't advice anyone to get this phone, most especially from this particular sellers.",4

If I was you I would buy somewhere else. When I first opened the box the phone looked like it was in great shape, its when I first turned it on that I noticed that there was something wrong.... the screen had burnt in images and not just a little bit I mean bad.. I fear that I got a display model... the screen had lifting issues were the screen is separating from the phone itself. Finally the s pen was busted. The sensitivity wouldnt adjust and the tip was worn to nothing. The sad part is this phone was supposed to be refurbished. its a good thing im tech savvy or else I would have returned it. I installed the new screen for cheap and got a new s pen for cheap. I love this phone and recommend it to anyone interested in it. I would just buy from someone else",12

Samsung Note 2 I317 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Phone - White (International Version),Samsung,159.95,5,"My friend loves it and he praises it every day. I popped in his AT&T sim and he was able to get it up and running with no issue. He works and plays on it every chance he gets when we're out at the restaurant. So that's one phone that's got more attention than me. LOL, but overall he was happy with the movies and music files I loaded on his 32GB SD . I'm an Apple lover and not a fandroid. Not that I have any problems with Android phones (i.e. Google phone - 1st generation). But I have to admit I love the response on it and the display is ridiculously ""big"". I can do the same thing pretty much on my iPad mini using Skype or Pinger to make phone calls. Anyhow, get a case and get a Zagg Shield to protect the display from cracking and getting scratched. Highly recommended on any big phone purchases.",2

Samsung Note 2 I317 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Phone - White (International Version),Samsung,159.95,5,"I was a little worried about purchasing such a large phone but in the end after always wishing I had a bigger screen decided to give it a try. I'm so glad that I did. I even have small (female) hands and I have not found, so far, any issues with having a large phone. I love the camera, the screen, the larger keyboard and even have discovered that I use the S-pen (which I never thought I'd even remove from its cubby). I never have any issues reading texts or emails (the type is large enough to not have to expand the view). And the features (I find a couple of new ones every day) are amazing! There are some gimmicky features, sure! But I am surprised how many features of this phone I have now integrated into my daily routine. I no longer carry a sketchbook (interior design student) or a note pad (list maker). I just pull out the s-pen and all of my sketches and lists are created and stored in the same spot. I also love the fact that I can just jot down a friend's contact info and then save it into my phone! The camera isn't the best on the market these days but I can't complain at all! I knew when I was doing my research that other phones had better cameras but so far the Note 2 has far surpassed my expectations! The battery is surprisingly powerful too given how often I use this phone throughout the day. Because of it's generous size and ease of use I am constantly looking up anything and everything online whereas with my previous phone I sometimes put it off until I could use my laptop. I also have put away my Kindle and have now added the Kindle app to my phone. Again, since the screen is larger I have no problem reading books right on my phone. Once again, I love this phone! It does everything but wash my dishes.",35

"Samsung Note 4 N910F 32 GB, Blossom Pink",,2000,5,"I've had the phone for two days now and so far it works great. But when I turned it on, the start up screen has Japanese writing, and some other features are written in Japanese but it was just stuff like website suggestions, and the time/weather and location is automatically set to another countries info so you'll have to fiddle with all that and set it to your own but then it'll all be correct to your own location so it wasn't a big deal. I have not put service on it yet, I'm just using it on wifi but I'll update this once I do put service on it and let you know how it works.Also when I first turned it on, it needed to be updated several times which in turn, killed the battery quickly, but don't worry about it, after you charge it again, it will drain much slower because the phone doesn't have to work as hard.One thing I want to note is the front facing camera is odd. If you go to take a ""selfie"" and you angle your face towards the bottom of the screen of top, it makes your face look really long and funny almost like kooking in a carnival mirror. But if you center your face it looks normal.Camera is very HD, battery life is nice, finger print lock, heart rate monitor located on the back, built in S pen, applications can be moved around screen.",0

Anyway, the phone came and the box it came in looked like it was thrown around by the handlers but the bubble wrap packaging inside was sufficient enough to withstand the carrier abuse. For it being used, I was very satisfied with it being still in great shape for the price, I was expecting some scratches and maybe even a dent or two but nope it was in great condition and I was happy with this, I took out my T-Mobile sim out of my old phone and installed it and it pretty much came up with no hiccups or any problems, LTE works perfectly, overall I am very satisfied with the phone and would buy again from Zeetron.

First thing I did before putting all my data/contacts/apps/simcard in was remove as much of touchwhiz and bloatware as possible. I do have to say the touchwiz has gotten a lot better compared to my galaxy S3.When Cyanogenmod stable releases for this, I will probably put that on.Hardware-wise, its excellent, and once I removed the bloatware, the battery life was impressive.

"Samsung Note 4 N910F 32 GB, Blossom Pink",,2000,2,"Screen cracked after the first accidental drop!. It's a great phone pertaining to features and internals, the smart stylus is truly unique with a lot of potential for creativity, camera can create a wonderful photos, but I was surprised that it couldn't endure a single accidental drop ( on the corner of the frame, not the screen itself ) that resulted in screen glass crack. And for this to happen the first day... Big disappointment.. I contacted Samsung they said they can't take the phone for repair, even if I am willing to pay whatever it takes, because it was an international version ! I still recommend this phone, I would rate 5 stars for the internals, features, stylus, camera, productivity, but these two stars are for the falsly advertising the corning Gorilla glass being very hard ! May be it is my phone from a bad batch... I recommend, if you get this phone, to be very careful not to drop it, even if you have a protective screen on it.Attached is the cracked screen photo.",6

"Samsung Note 4 N910F 32 GB, Blossom Pink",,2000,5,"I've been struggling with the Exynos 5433 model N910C for almost a year.I'm an Android power user / flashaholic & I gotta have custom everything. I thought I was buying the right device when I saw ""trltexx"" on Cyanogenmod's site. Unfortunately, I discovered my error at the last possible moment after I had already rooted the device & tried to install CM. ""trltexx"" is N910F. ""treltexx"" is N910C. Whoops!But, I tried to make the best of it & found stuff on XDA Developers that I could work with for a while. And that got old. I yearned for an easier experience with my device.Having the two side by side fully customized with TWRP 2.8.7.0, Cyanogenmod 13 & all the same apps & data, I notice a significant performance boost with the Snapdragon based N910F.The N910C does not have official Cyanogenmod support, but N910F does.CM13 is UNofficial for both devices at this time. Super smooth on N910F & performs well under load. Kernel Adiutor (not a typo) handles CPU frequency scaling (& overclocking, if you're into that) like a champ.I love the Note 4 & I'm glad I switched models.P.S. I pulled my nano SIM for Straight Talk (AT&T) from N910C, put into N910F & was up & going without further configuration on device or Straight Talk website.",1

The Samsung Note 4 compromises very little. It's fast, powerful, light, functional, has a great screen, takes awesome photos, has an SD memory card capability, an amazing writing stylus built in. All that being said, one of the best features is the ability to easily replace a battery. All this power and performance eats up batteries and while the Note 4 is pretty good at managing power, it is still a glutton for power. The beauty of this device, in addition to all its great specs and features, is that you can readily pop off the back and replace the battery. What a novel idea. Duh!

"Samsung Note 4 N910F 32 GB, Blossom Pink",,2000,5,"N910F is an unlocked phone:This means that you can only connect it to GSM networks (not CDMA networks like Verizon or Sprint).This also means that you will need to add configuration information specific to your service provider.This also means that you can travel with it internationally, and buy local pre-paid SIM cards, so you're paying local rates for local calls and data, vs International rates.AT&T users:The phone comes with basic instructions on how to connect to AT&T, but better instructions are available directly from AT&T [https://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB424489].ROOT users:If you plan to ROOT the device, be aware that you'll need to upgrade it with the version 5.0.1 stock bootloader/firmware first (as it comes with 5.0), otherwise you'll receive a bootup error after you install a rooted ROM. Fortunately, even if you're reading this after you've tried to install a rooted ROM, you can go back and installed the stock 5.01 bootloader, and then re-install the rooted ROM.Transferring an SD card from another phone:If you're using an SD card from a previous phone, even if it's an Android, you'll need to reformat your SD card before installing new apps, otherwise the write permissions will cause an issue were downloads seem to hang.

"Samsung Note 4 N910F 32 GB, Blossom Pink",,2000,5,Beautiful phone. I've been using prepaid phones for years now. But their servers have always been problematic. I wanted to go with a better carrier without being locked into a silly contract so I decided to by an unlocked phone. The phone is exactly as described. Brand spanking new and unlocked. I was nervous because the phone manual and the phone was pre-set in Chinese. But I took the phone to AT&T and they were able to activate the phone with no problems. I have 4G and the phone works great. I was nervous about buying an unlocked phone because of all the horror stories I've heard. But so far my experience has been great. I can't speak for other phone carriers but my phone works 100% with AT&T.,3

"Samsung Note 4 N910F 32 GB, Blossom Pink",,2000,5,Initially I was confused between iPhone 6 plus and the Note 4.

"Samsung Note 4 N910F 32 GB, Blossom Pink",,2000,5,"Bought this phone for use in the US on AT&T. Initially there were issues but I was prepared to have some and AT&T helped fix them. One issue I still have is that the carrier websites do not recognize the IMEI # for the phone. I had to speak with someone to get the phone working on the network. I've also found my AT&T signal is maxing at 4G (NO LTE) with 2 bars but on average I'm getting H to H+ service. The One X+ I'm switching from had MUCH better signal strength, I believe this to be related to band issues and would like to add it was something I was prepared for thus I'm not letting it effect my review. Samsung's UI isn't too painful just yet and I'm LOVING the screen on this thing. WIFI signal strength is solid.DO KNOW when ordering this version you will receive a European charging cable, USB works fine but the quick charge plug included will not work here in the US without an adapter.",1

Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,I read all the good reviews on this phone and the price was right so I ordered it. This phone is a great basic phone and works well for what I need and it was only $10. Really like it.,4
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,4,Good reception everywhere. The sound is loud and clear. The buttons are a little small if you have big hands and it shuts off unexpectedly when using an SD card.,2
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,"I have been with Net10 for 8 months now and I switched from a Bring Your Own Phone SIM card to this Samsung. My unlocked HP Pre 3 messed up and I saw this for only $9.99 FREE PRIME shipping. It was a steal.This phone is exactly what I needed. It has features many basic phones don't have nowadays. Things like a dedicated camera button, a cover for the USB charging port to avoid dust getting in and a standard headset jack. The menu is very basic, nothing out of the ordinary, easy to read. As far as the network goes, I did some research and after activating this phone I am certain the networks got switched from T-Mobile to Verizon Wireless coverage. This phone runs on Verizon's CDMA 1X network. Which is also a big plus for me because I have better signal and I'm saving $5 with Net10 over Verizon's Unlimited for basic phones plan. Very happy with my purchase. The only negative thing I would point out is the keyboard itself feels really cheap. It has good tactile feedback but you can definitely feel the cheapness of it. I don't really mind as long as I can text fast on it. Which I think is achievable once I get used to the keyboard. If this phone messes up I can always get a second one. At only $9.99 who wouldn't?",4

Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,"I bought two of these from Amazon. I am currently using one of them. This is a Solid phone when it comes to net10 pay as you go phones and I have had a number of net10 phones over the years. I have seen some reviews on other prepaid phones and see the compliants about the browser speed. This is not an Android phone, if it's speed you want, buy an android, if it's just a basic Talk and text phone, then this is the type of phone to buy. This phone is a CDMA phone, it doesn't have a SIM card in it. I have read in an online forum that this phone actually uses the Verizon Towers so the signal is carried by them. I have had no signal problems thus far with this phone no matter where I have been in my area, though there are different factors that can come into play when it comes to cellphone signal strengths and weakness's. The keyboard on this phone is easy to navigate, I do wish they had made the keys just a tiny bit larger but it is not a deal breaker as I have adapted to it and it's not an issue for me. There are several other functions with this phone, one of my Favorties is the Tip calculator, I'm admittedly lousy at math, it's handy to have! There is a Memo pad, another handy tool to have to write a note to save, Remember, a note...not a book. It has a calendar as well as a calculator, it also has a camera, again, this is a prepaid phone camera, don't expect over the top pictures, but they afre not bad at all...for this type of phone. The battery life on this phone is outstanding too. I highly reccomend this phone.",7
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,4,"This phone works just fine for someone who just needs a phone. I got the 750 minute plan and I have loads of minutes to burn through, so I tried using the browser. It wasn't as slow as the other reviews led me to believe it would be. It worked ok, but it is a little clunky and difficult to navigate. I'll only use it in emergency situations. I haven't tried the 411 service yet, but I suspect that will be faster than using the internet. The sound and the ringer are both good. The keyboard works well for me, but the buttons are too small for my husband to use. The battery life is excellent. Good phone for the money.",2
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,I love this phone. It's easy to use. The only thing I do not like about it is it can easily go into the browser and burn away minutes if you aren't very very careful. But that's all I do not like about it.,2
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,"I just wanted a basic phone, and this is it. Don't expect Internet access, Facebook, etc, with this thing.My friends mostly have phones costing 2-4 times this much per month (I use the $25/month 750 minute plan). But their phones don't work in buildings, elevators, on the subway, etc., and mine does. It seems that Net10 rents working wireless access from expensive companies and then sells it to us.I have purchased 3 of these phones. One was defective enough to return it, and a second one refuses to go into autolock mode, so I often find it browsing the net or writing its own text messages. To my knowledge it has never actually butt-dialed anyone. I can lock it by just holding down the spacebar, but I often forget. It has never managed to use up my minutes, anyway.A fourth Net10 phone also died before I started with these Samsungs. So why do I give them 5 stars? Because they are practically giving these phones away, and the per month charge is reasonable by US standards.The only reason I don't get yet another phone and dump my slightly defective one is that I'll have to type in about 300 digits to reprogram the new phone to take over my account.As far as usability, the phone is great. The keyboard is fine, even though the keys are tiny and I can barely see them without glasses, it is miles better than my previous 'cheap' phones, which cost much more than these. The menus are well organized, and I use the phone as my daily alarm as well. I like the ringtones selection.",2
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,4,"I just started using it but, I haven't noticed any problems. It seems to work well. No Complaints as of yet, but i will let you know if there is.",2
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,4,"First off you should know that this phone only charges .25 minutes per text received and send which is 50% of the regular Net10 phones and the main reason of my purchase, that being said...Important info you should know about this phone.Features: 1.3Mega Pixel camera, Long battery life, Quarty KeyboardMy impressions: Keys are small but easy to type on, this phone does not support T9 word and calling numbers is slightly more annoying since the keys are smaller then most are used to. I can't comment on the browser features since for some reason the phone is roaming in the Wyoming area where I am located and it says data restriction 36 but from videos the browser is nothing special.It is also worth mentioning that you can record your own ringtones and transfer audio and images back and forth from your computer via a data cable or blue tooth adapter. Picture quality is better then my old 1.3MP camera which was a scoop but it's still nothing amazing, I'm sure everyone has seen what most cell phone pictures are like, and this phone is no exception, but still it is nice to have the feature.Also you can lock the keypad by pressing and holding the spacebar down.Features aren't great but you can get around 300 minutes or about 1200 text for 20$ per month on this phone which is very cheap for those of us who don't talk much.",71
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,received phone early..fast delivery...nice phone..even though its an older model stores still carry this model..kmart sells it for $99 .. i will be buying another for myself..this one was for my son..thanks amazon,13
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,"Good ""slightly more than just basic"" phone. Has good ringer volume, call quality and signal strength. Works off verizon as it is a CDMA. I don't take pics but this phone has a pretty decent camera. The mp3 player is above average sound quality. 3.5 headphone jack. Easy to lock keyboard by pressing space bar. Only thing I would change is the keys are a bit small but you get used to them. All in all, if you don't want to pay 80 or 90 bucks for a ""supposedly"" better phone with these features, this is the phone for you. I like it a lot. Have 2 of them. One for straight talk and the other for net 10. One more thing, this phone has the most economical texting plan, it's only 0.25 min per text. Other phones it's 0.50. For me that was a big selling point.For your interest: it was hard for me to pair the samsung r355c by bluetooth to transfer contacts. First the passkey for bluetooth was 00000 then it switched to 11111. It was very fustrating to figure out so hope this avoids this for the next customer.",4
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,2,"I ordered this phone as a replacement for another Net 10 phone, which had been giving me trouble for ages. Oh, what I would give to have that phone back!My main complaint about this phone is that whoever designed it didn't give too much thought to usability/ease of use. In the Web design world, there is a general rule that a user should never have to click more than twice to get to any page on a site. The developer of this phone certainly did not have that rule in mind. I may be missing it, but I have not been able to find a speaker function on this phone. That means I can't drive while using it (no Bluetooth feature either) and I can't use the speaker when I am typing and making business calls. The phone often has to be reset because the clock stops or the date is wrong.The keyboard is also kind of weird. I thought you could use the shift button to switch from letters to numbers, but you can't. You have to click 123/sym, write out the number, and then go back to Abc/abc to write the rest of a message. This is a pain in the butt if you are trying to write several numbers in a message, as you have to keep switching between 123/sym and Abc/abc. All in all, this is not a good phone.",5

Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,4,"After looking at smart phones, and noting that the user manuals were typically 500 pp. (not, alas, an exaggeration), I realized that a phone of middling intelligence would suit me just fine. The price here was 50% - 60% less than on other sites. It arrived promptly, and does all that I ask it to do: call, text, and function as my alarm clock. It does have Internet connectivity, but it's so slow, it's like time-travel back to the 1990s. I knew that going in, however. If you need to be able to update your twitter and/or Facebook frequently from your phone, keep on looking. If you just want a, you know, a *phone*, this is smart enough.",69
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,"After recently becoming one of America's newest smartphone customers, I was going to pass my pristine¬†Samsung A797 Flight Red At&t Qwerty Keyboard Touch Screen 3g Gps Cell Phone¬†to my youngest daughter until I saw this phone listed on Amazon.com.First off, the deal is crazy. Less than 25 dollars for this phone!Secondly, I like Net10, because you can switch their calling plans hassle-free! I can easily tailor my daughter's plan to her actual cell phone usage!Add a cute ""blinged-out"" phone case¬†Samsung R355c Blue Circle Silver Jewel Bling Dazzle Diamonds Protector Straight Talk Net 10 HardCase Cover Skin NET 10 Straight Talk¬†and a phone charm, and she is in business!Did I mention the insane price, and that the phone arrived BRAND NEW, unopened, still in the box?It doesn't support Opera, but I was able to bookmark Google Mobile, which automatically gives her Google Maps (of course, she isn't going to need that yet, but it's nice to have, LOL).The phone also has a surprisingly decent mp3 player (you can upload music to it using a data cable), camera (no video, but your pics can be customized!), expandable memory and a standard 3.5mm headphone jack! You cannot watch YouTube videos, but you can use your mp3's for ringtones, something that too many contract (read: expensive) phones still won't allow you to do! The calls themselves come in clear. So far, we've had no problems with reception (everything works where we live, so we're probably not going to have too many issues with dropped calls).Best of all, my daughter LOVES her new phone.Thank you SO MUCH for providing this item for Amazon customers at such a great price!**UPDATE**Just a little tip....it costs 3.5 minutes to send an MMS, so if possible, link your device via Bluetooth and send MMS that way.",26
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,"I've had this phone for about a month now and it's become very helpful.I only use it for job/quick calls, I'm not much of a talker so I needed a prepaid phone.I bought a 200min card from NET10 the same day I got it and after a month, i still have 100+ min left. Buying this phone was definitely the right choice because it was cheap and I don't need a plan.It's a very light and has common cellphone features. The thing that I dislike, is that if you don't lock it, the browser button might get dialed by accident and then your minutes will just go. Happened to me twice but I quickly realized...i lost like 10min.It has a nice design and the camera is ok. This cellphone is nothing fancy but it does the job.The keypad buttons are kinda small but my hands are small so it's ok.Since I usually have the screen turned off, the battery lasts a lot of time. I never let it past 2 bars(out of 5) so I don't know how long it truly lasts. (I only remember charging it twice, when 3 bars left, ever since i got it a month ago)",21
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,"In an effort to better control monthly expenses, I switched to this net 10 phone. I have had two android based phones (2.2 and 2.3) and a couple of blackberries. This phone had great battery life and very good reception. It is very light and has a type of plastic on the sides that will prevent it from easily slipping out of your hand. The MP3 player is nice, but I haven't found any equalizer settings...the sound is still good though. It isn't a smart phone, but is is a great little text phone. The browser works for basic things, like a quick email check. The camera is fine for quick snap shots and seems to do pretty well in average indoor lighting. If you live in a CDMA area with limited GSM service like I do, and you want to go the Net10 route, this is a good phone, especially for the price! There is a newer version of this phone available for Straight Talk (R375c) that has better screen resolution and better web browser capabilities, but I haven't seen it available for Net10. For now, this phone is just fine.",4
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,"I have been through two other phones with Net10 and this phone kept me with the service.

This way, I have a good quality phone with some of the most sophisticated technology available to use. If I lose it or it get dropped into water, not that much of a loss. I can get another phone from Net10 and have the number and minutes transferred. The phone has so many features and is very easy to use and understand.",0

Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,4,"Ive owned this phone a little over a month now and for the most part do not regret buying it at current price, $9. However it Is not without A few aggravating features. The keyboard is small, as others have mentioned, so if you have large fingers it might not suit you. Also, there is now way of deactivating the browser that I am aware of and believe me I've looked for one. The browser is a one button push, and the only defense from doing this is to lock the keyboard by holding down the space button, which I forget to do sometimes. I just learned you can set the phone to lock the keyboard after a time of inactivity, in case you forget to lock it like I do.I was skeptical that this phone only charged you .25 minutes a text that another reviewer mentioned but sure enough it does, although I just noticed it also charges you 1 minute a call whether the person you are calling answers or not, which to the best of my knowledge doesn't happen with other net 10 phones.The mp3 player is a nice feature and can use up to 16 GB of ...which is quite a lot of music.Can't comment too much about the camera save for the fact you cannot zoom in after you snap a photo.Speaker is on par with other cheap phones.I would suggest this phone to anyone who has small fingers that likes to text, additionally they have a very similar phone at Kroger grocery store at the moment if you want to get an idea of the keyboard size. It is a Samsung with slightly different Model numbers. ThE 355c has a very slightly smaller keyboard than the one at Kroger.",1

It does not have the ability to use apps except for those limited few that come with it, but at least it looks more modern than other basic phones. The browser is slow, but you can get your email and Facebook in due time, so it's good in a pinch. Call quality is as good as the Verizon system this phone uses, so if Verizon is good in your area, this phone is as good as it gets for call quality. Test messaging is as good as any smart phone. It has an Mp3 player with playlists, and it will connect to any Bluetooth device to play music in your car or through a Bluetooth speaker. There is no Wi-Fi. I like the real keyboard as opposed to the touch keyboards of other phones. I like the real buttons as opposed to the touch screen, so for me, this works well for my needs.

Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,4,"I've been using the Samsung r355c n10 phone for a little over 2 weeks and so far so great. Granted, it's not top quality but considering that it only costs $9.99, this phone is certainly worth the purchase, that is if you're looking for basic phone use (i.e. making phone calls, texting, as well as using the calendar, calculator, alarm etc.). However, if you want a phone that includes a fast internet connection, a camera that takes quality pictures, or video recording ability, you should look elsewhere. As for me, I'm happy with this phone so far and I'm also happy with Amazon. As usual Amazon delivered on time and the merchandise was in perfect condition. Thanks, Amazon :-DHere is what I've experienced & observed so far:BATTERY POWER: I tested the phone out a lot during the first few days. In other words, heavy usage. It took a little over 2 days before I had to recharge the battery. Then when I hardly used the phone (just a few short calls and several texting), the battery lasted for 5-6 days before I had to recharge. As of now, I'm happy with the battery. I just hope it'll stay this strong for a while.CALL RECEPTION: Solid reception. I can hear the person on the other end clearly and vice versa. With regard to dropped calls, I have not had one yet.CAMERA: Pictures aren't the best quality but they come out good enough. Unfortunately, there's no zoom which is a huge bummer for me since I'm a frequent user of the zoom feature. However, there are other features which make taking pictures fun, such as the series shot; mosaic shot; and my favorite, fun frames. For me that makes up a little for the quality of the pics.INTERNET ACCESS: This feature is ok for occasional use. However if you're looking for a phone mostly for internet browsing (if you internet daily for hours), you may want to look around and see what other choices are out there. As for this Samsung r355c phone, it's 10 cents a minute to internet; and be aware that the first minute will be deducted as soon as you press the browser key. The downloading of website pages is a bit slow to complete. I could not browse or navigate through any site until the downloading completely finished. I got 2 minutes deducted, once, for just visiting one page w/o hardly reading anything. If you do get this phone, this feature is not too bad if you have the time to wait for pages to download.KEYPAD:1). The key buttons are really small which worried me a bit because my fingers are medium sized and I keep my nails really short so I thought I'd have problems (i.e. pressing 2 keys at once or pressing the wrong keys). Surprisingly I've had no trouble typing. It's pretty easy.2). When not using the phone, it's best to lock the keypad down by holding down the space key for a few seconds. When the keypad is unlocked, it's easy to accidentally hit the browser key unknowingly and be charged for every minute the browser is on.3). Fyi the red ""End pwr"" key is the ""home"" key. I didn't know that until I read the instruction booklet a few days later. I kept pressing the ""back"" key a few times to get out of features like the camera mode, text messages, calendar, etc. just to get back to the home screen. Doh!SPEAKER: The clarity is excellent. MUCH clearer than my 2 laptops' speakers that's for sure.TEXT MSG: It was nice to find out it only costs 2 &1/2 cents (0.25 minutes) per text compared to the 10 cents (1.00 minute) I used to pay prior to switching to this phone. I also like that there's a character count which lets you know when you're about to hit the maximum (160 character per text). The one thing missing is the copy/cut/paste features. But it's a minor issue considering the price of this phone.TEXT PICTURE MSG: It cost 35 cents (3.50 minutes) to send & to receive a picture text message. I was a little bummed about that but oh well, it's still good.VIDEO RECORDER: there is none :-(I know I'm leaving out info about other features this phone offers, but hopefully what I already have written down will help some people decide whether or not this phone will suit their needs.",4
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,4,Bought the product to replace a prior phone that had a cracked screen. Set up was easy to transfer prior account thru Net 10 and the price for the phone was cheap. If your looking for an android phone you need look no farther.,0

The C is for CDMA -Verizon service for me. That may depend on the zip code that you activate the phone in. This phone is small and actually takes half decent pix, though I would never use it for trying to do anything with them other that looking at them on the phone itself. I mainly use them for backgrounds on the phone. Call quality is great. I love the querty keyboard. I would never have a touch screen only keyboard. -That's just me. Bluetooth works great with my Mazda, I never have to touch the phone to make/receive calls.Tip, you have to keep it locked, which you can do manually by holding the space key or set autolock. Otherwise, the internet key can very easily get pressed and eat up your minutes. I would like a way to disable that key!",3
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,"I lost my first one of these 2 days ago. I had it over a year.I researched other Net10 CDMA phones, as I prefer the Verizon network. I also have Net10 LG900g, which is GSM, on ATT. (That is also a good phone, by the way...but Verizon is better in our area).I ordered another one of the R355C, not only because of the price. The phone clarity was great, texting was easy for me, alarm clock worked fine, all the things I really needed it for. It has a good speakerphone.The camera is not that great, because there is no zoom, etc. No extra features. You can't even enlarge it at all when someone sends a pic message. Sometimes you have to ask them what it is a photo of. That is the state of this camera. (the LG900g has a nice camera).The browser, well, it's a browser. Not a smartphone. You definitely can check email and news, sports, whatever you want. It is slow, though, and not a computer experience. But it does work and you can indeed get your Internet fix if you have to.As a phone, as a texter, as an alarm clock, as a calculator, etc., it is wonderful. I was really sad to lose my first one and really happy to find another one here at this price.*** UPDATE **** The first one I received now was DOA. Not sure if battery or phone itself. Ordered a replacement for it, and now this one is shutting itself off after a few minutes. I need to return both. Should I try this model again? I don't know... I loved the one I lost...that is why I ordered another. So disappointing that these 2 replacements are not good.**** Second UPDATE **** The seller has graciously replaced this for me with a new one that works just great. Happy again.",2

Will try to send a message to supplier but because this is not directly through Amazon do not know how yet.Update great people to deal with shipping replacement battery.,8
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,"I bought this phone so I could answer text messages from my kids, grandkids and brothers without taking 3 minutes to text 3 words. At first I was a little concerned about the small buttons but I got used to them very quickly. I get much better reception than my old phone. I don't have to stop in my tracks when I'm in the store and my wife calls me to add to our grocery list. It did take almost the full 72 hours for Net10 to transfer my old phone number and minutes, but it was well worth the wait.",7

Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,3,"Not a smart phone, but this one does everything well, though the keyboard is extremely small. Also, the voicemail occasionally sends your old messages to you as if they just came in, and in normal course doesn't give you verbal dates and times.",0
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,"Brand new in the box. This is my third R355C. It is a long lasting phone that works better than the other phones (same cellular phone service) I have had. Says it is internet capable, but so slow it is worthless to me.

Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,3,"Rightfully, I should probably give this product one star rather than three, but I‚Äôm considering the possibility that I just got a defective cell. I bought this as a cheap efficient way to make and receive important calls. Unfortunately it‚Äôs never worked. Out of the box, the phone proved incapable of keeping a charge longer than one day. What‚Äôs more is that after a painstaking activation; I say this because after registering the product on Net 10‚Äôs website the phone still didn‚Äôt work. I had to call Net 10 from a land line so that a customer service representative could walk me through the process of putting in about 8 to 10 activation codes. After this, the phone couldn‚Äôt receive a signal‚Ä¶ almost anywhere. In a very few locations we were able to make calls, but nowhere that it actually counted. It wouldn‚Äôt even work at our home whereas we‚Äôve had AT&T and Verizon phones which work just fine. After calling Net 10 again, the customer service representative deduced that the produce was defective and that they would send a new phone. I was fine with this even putting aside that we‚Äôd had the produce well over a month and never got to use it. After repeating the home address to the representative three times, he still got it wrong. The package ended up at a FedEx several miles away and they couldn‚Äôt resend the package. So, I called Net 10 yet again to explain the problem to them. They said that they‚Äôd send another phone and never did. Instead they cancelled my service with them which is just fine as I would‚Äôve done that anyway. The bottom line is that I gave this item three stars out of grace. I assume that if you get a working product there will be no problem, but be forewarned that costumer service is terrible should you have an actual problem.",0

Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,"This is my third Net10 phone. First two were AT&T phones, lots not to like about AT&T in southwest CT (IMHO), so I made sure this is Verizon, and it is! (G at the end of the name indicates AT&T, C means Verizon.)Most important functionality for me is good coverage (Verizon), good voice commands (reliable Bluetooth) and decent texting ability (not bad on this device).My first phone (Samsung T401G) was a slider, which really does beat the fakeBerry style phone for texting, but the phone had no voice dialing, so Bluetooth was not fully functional. Scratch that.My second phone was a Samsung R455G (AT&T). It looked much like this phone and was actually heftier, nicer casing, a kind of mini-track pad for moving the cursor. It looked more like the $40 I paid rather than this $10 phone. BUT, the Bluetooth was the weirdest I've ever encountered (I wrote a review on Amazon), and any time you hit the space bar when texting, you were equally likely to get a period. So you. Would get. Sentences. Like this. Scratch that.So, with the R355C I get Verizon connectivity, a NORMAL fully-functional Bluetooth, and the ability to text relatively easily. I actually find typing on the fakeBerry much easier than I would have thought. The worst is all the overlays (for punctuation and things like $ / etc.), which, if you have started losing your fine eyesight as I have, is murder, because it's very hard to see what's on each key. I suppose over the life of the phone I will get used to the most common things I use, but while the phone is new it's a bit of a drag. Not the phone's fault.Unlike some phones with exposed buttons (like the R455G), this phone does not lock itself every time it goes dark, which is a feature I actually like. You can easily lock it (hold the space bar) before putting it in your purse, but if it's sitting on your desk, it doesn't lock up every time it goes dormant, which is great if you're in the midst of a somewhat sporadic text exchange. Somewhat unusually, to unlock the phone you press a soft key and the space bar rather than the center or ""ok"" button, which seems the more common configuration.Haven't had it long enough to comment on battery life, but it seems better than the 455, which had terrible battery life.",1
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,1,"....because I was unable to activate it. When I called NET10 about it and stayed on the line with 3 different customer service departments for 30 minutes, I was told that this phone had already been activated. It was activated last month in California (1500 miles away) and already had a telephone number assigned to it. So, this seller obviously sold me a previously activated phone, and wasted my time, since no one could help me activate it. Since it was only $10, it isn't worth the time or gas to take it back to the UPS store. So, into the garbage it goes. (Nice little charger though. I will keep that part)",3

Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,4,"First off you should know that this phone only charges .25 minutes per text received and send which is 50% of the regular Net10 phones and the main reason of my purchase, that being said...Important info you should know about this phone.Features: 1.3Mega Pixel camera, Long battery life, Quarty KeyboardMy impressions: Keys are small but easy to type on, this phone does not support T9 word and calling numbers is slightly more annoying since the keys are smaller then most are used to. I can't comment on the browser features since for some reason the phone is roaming in the Wyoming area where I am located and it says data restriction 36 but from videos the browser is nothing special.It is also worth mentioning that you can record your own ringtones and transfer audio and images back and forth from your computer via a data cable or blue tooth adapter. Picture quality is better then my old 1.3MP camera which was a scoop but it's still nothing amazing, I'm sure everyone has seen what most cell phone pictures are like, and this phone is no exception, but still it is nice to have the feature.Also you can lock the keypad by pressing and holding the spacebar down.Features aren't great but you can get around 300 minutes or about 1200 text for 20$ per month on this phone which is very cheap for those of us who don't talk much.",71

Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,1,"This phone is best used when you live in a major city because it contains different data than regular NET 10 phones. I live in a rural farm country of Texas and could not keep a signal. Therefore my phone could not be used but was usable when I traveled to two different major cities in Texas. For example, I could use it in Ft. Worth, Texas and in Abilene, Texas. I am not saying it is a bad phone what I am saying is that if you do not live in a major city with excellent cell reception I do not advise buying this phone.",2

Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,I have been using the SamSung R355C Net10 Unlimited for several years. I am still using my original phone after 4 years and have purchased several for friends who needed good reliable phones and they are still using theirs. I don't talk a lot so I use the 60 day unlimited carry over plan while several friends go for for the unlimited plans. Net 10 offers a variety of plans to suit most needs. The phone is reliable and Net10 on the Verizon network is reliable also with very good coverage. I recommended this phone to anyone who wants a basic phone with occasional data usage.,0

Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,"Good ""slightly more than just basic"" phone. Has good ringer volume, call quality and signal strength. Works off verizon as it is a CDMA. I don't take pics but this phone has a pretty decent camera. The mp3 player is above average sound quality. 3.5 headphone jack. Easy to lock keyboard by pressing space bar. Only thing I would change is the keys are a bit small but you get used to them. All in all, if you don't want to pay 80 or 90 bucks for a ""supposedly"" better phone with these features, this is the phone for you. I like it a lot. Have 2 of them. One for straight talk and the other for net 10. One more thing, this phone has the most economical texting plan, it's only 0.25 min per text. Other phones it's 0.50. For me that was a big selling point.For your interest: it was hard for me to pair the samsung r355c by bluetooth to transfer contacts. First the passkey for bluetooth was 00000 then it switched to 11111. It was very fustrating to figure out so hope this avoids this for the next customer.",4
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,2,"I ordered this phone as a replacement for another Net 10 phone, which had been giving me trouble for ages. Oh, what I would give to have that phone back!My main complaint about this phone is that whoever designed it didn't give too much thought to usability/ease of use. In the Web design world, there is a general rule that a user should never have to click more than twice to get to any page on a site. The developer of this phone certainly did not have that rule in mind. I may be missing it, but I have not been able to find a speaker function on this phone. That means I can't drive while using it (no Bluetooth feature either) and I can't use the speaker when I am typing and making business calls. The phone often has to be reset because the clock stops or the date is wrong.The keyboard is also kind of weird. I thought you could use the shift button to switch from letters to numbers, but you can't. You have to click 123/sym, write out the number, and then go back to Abc/abc to write the rest of a message. This is a pain in the butt if you are trying to write several numbers in a message, as you have to keep switching between 123/sym and Abc/abc. All in all, this is not a good phone.",5

Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,4,"After looking at smart phones, and noting that the user manuals were typically 500 pp. (not, alas, an exaggeration), I realized that a phone of middling intelligence would suit me just fine. The price here was 50% - 60% less than on other sites. It arrived promptly, and does all that I ask it to do: call, text, and function as my alarm clock. It does have Internet connectivity, but it's so slow, it's like time-travel back to the 1990s. I knew that going in, however. If you need to be able to update your twitter and/or Facebook frequently from your phone, keep on looking. If you just want a, you know, a *phone*, this is smart enough.",69

You cannot watch YouTube videos, but you can use your mp3's for ringtones, something that too many contract (read: expensive) phones still won't allow you to do! The calls themselves come in clear. So far, we've had no problems with reception (everything works where we live, so we're probably not going to have too many issues with dropped calls).Best of all, my daughter LOVES her new phone.Thank you SO MUCH for providing this item for Amazon customers at such a great price!**UPDATE**Just a little tip....it costs 3.5 minutes to send an MMS, so if possible, link your device via Bluetooth and send MMS that way.",26
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,"I've had this phone for about a month now and it's become very helpful.I only use it for job/quick calls, I'm not much of a talker so I needed a prepaid phone.I bought a 200min card from NET10 the same day I got it and after a month, i still have 100+ min left. Buying this phone was definitely the right choice because it was cheap and I don't need a plan.It's a very light and has common cellphone features. The thing that I dislike, is that if you don't lock it, the browser button might get dialed by accident and then your minutes will just go. Happened to me twice but I quickly realized...i lost like 10min.It has a nice design and the camera is ok. This cellphone is nothing fancy but it does the job.The keypad buttons are kinda small but my hands are small so it's ok.Since I usually have the screen turned off, the battery lasts a lot of time. I never let it past 2 bars(out of 5) so I don't know how long it truly lasts. (I only remember charging it twice, when 3 bars left, ever since i got it a month ago)",21
Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,"In an effort to better control monthly expenses, I switched to this net 10 phone. I have had two android based phones (2.2 and 2.3) and a couple of blackberries. This phone had great battery life and very good reception. It is very light and has a type of plastic on the sides that will prevent it from easily slipping out of your hand. The MP3 player is nice, but I haven't found any equalizer settings...the sound is still good though. It isn't a smart phone, but is is a great little text phone. The browser works for basic things, like a quick email check. The camera is fine for quick snap shots and seems to do pretty well in average indoor lighting. If you live in a CDMA area with limited GSM service like I do, and you want to go the Net10 route, this is a good phone, especially for the price! There is a newer version of this phone available for Straight Talk (R375c) that has better screen resolution and better web browser capabilities, but I haven't seen it available for Net10. For now, this phone is just fine.",4

Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,"I have been with Net10 for 8 months now and I switched from a Bring Your Own Phone SIM card to this Samsung. My unlocked HP Pre 3 messed up and I saw this for only $9.99 FREE PRIME shipping. It was a steal.This phone is exactly what I needed. It has features many basic phones don't have nowadays. Things like a dedicated camera button, a cover for the USB charging port to avoid dust getting in and a standard headset jack. The menu is very basic, nothing out of the ordinary, easy to read. As far as the network goes, I did some research and after activating this phone I am certain the networks got switched from T-Mobile to Verizon Wireless coverage. This phone runs on Verizon's CDMA 1X network. Which is also a big plus for me because I have better signal and I'm saving $5 with Net10 over Verizon's Unlimited for basic phones plan. Very happy with my purchase. The only negative thing I would point out is the keyboard itself feels really cheap. It has good tactile feedback but you can definitely feel the cheapness of it. I don't really mind as long as I can text fast on it. Which I think is achievable once I get used to the keyboard. If this phone messes up I can always get a second one.

This is a Solid phone when it comes to net10 pay as you go phones and I have had a number of net10 phones over the years. I have seen some reviews on other prepaid phones and see the compliants about the browser speed. This is not an Android phone, if it's speed you want, buy an android, if it's just a basic Talk and text phone, then this is the type of phone to buy. This phone is a CDMA phone, it doesn't have a SIM card in it. I have read in an online forum that this phone actually uses the Verizon Towers so the signal is carried by them. I have had no signal problems thus far with this phone no matter where I have been in my area, though there are different factors that can come into play when it comes to cellphone signal strengths and weakness's. The keyboard on this phone is easy to navigate, I do wish they had made the keys just a tiny bit larger but it is not a deal breaker as I have adapted to it and it's not an issue for me. There are several other functions with this phone, one of my Favorties is the Tip calculator, I'm admittedly lousy at math, it's handy to have! There is a Memo pad, another handy tool to have to write a note to save, Remember, a note...not a book. It has a calendar as well as a calculator, it also has a camera, again, this is a prepaid phone camera, don't expect over the top pictures, but they afre not bad at all...for this type of phone.

I haven't tried the 411 service yet, but I suspect that will be faster than using the internet. The sound and the ringer are both good.

Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited,Samsung,49.99,5,"I just wanted a basic phone, and this is it. Don't expect Internet access, Facebook, etc, with this thing.My friends mostly have phones costing 2-4 times this much per month (I use the $25/month 750 minute plan). But their phones don't work in buildings, elevators, on the subway, etc., and mine does. It seems that Net10 rents working wireless access from expensive companies and then sells it to us.I have purchased 3 of these phones. One was defective enough to return it, and a second one refuses to go into autolock mode, so I often find it browsing the net or writing its own text messages. To my knowledge it has never actually butt-dialed anyone. I can lock it by just holding down the spacebar, but I often forget. It has never managed to use up my minutes, anyway.A fourth Net10 phone also died before I started with these Samsungs. So why do I give them 5 stars? Because they are practically giving these phones away, and the per month charge is reasonable by US standards.The only reason I don't get yet another phone and dump my slightly defective one is that I'll have to type in about 300 digits to reprogram the new phone to take over my account.As far as usability, the phone is great. The keyboard is fine, even though the keys are tiny and I can barely see them without glasses, it is miles better than my previous 'cheap' phones, which cost much more than these.

"Samsung Reality SCH-U820 Phone, City Red (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,19.33,2,"The construction quality of this phone is horrible. The first one we got just stopped working one day. Probably the digitizer, because it would charge and turn on but the screen was unresponsive making the phone mostly useless. The people we ordered from were excellent and replced the unit, and that one worked until my daughter dropped it and the digitizer came off. I purchased a replacement digitizer, which is a pain to install, but it worked for a little while. My opinion is that the digitizer cable does not attach securely enough. You slide it into a slot and it just sits there, and if it doesn't stay in the slot properly there is no contact and the darn screen is no longer responsive. Based on the number of forum complaints, I'd say this is a common problem. My advice...look for another phone, especially if you are not comfortable taking apart electronics",0
"Samsung Reality SCH-U820 Phone, City Red (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,19.33,3,"this phone works great when it's working. great call quality, fast image processing, intuitive menu system, and a surprisingly high quality screen resolution to boot. however, drop it once, and the entire touch screen will come loose and fall out of the casing. it's quite a strange sight to see, and it can be up to a $45-$75 repair when it happens. and if it happens once, it will happen again even more easily than the first time.summary: excellent phone for someone who does not quite need a smart phone, but if you buy it, you simply MUST purchase a hard protective case that will help hold the screen in place.

It does have a $10/month data plan with my Verizon plan but the internet on this phone is almost useless. It like the internet on all phones over 10 years ago before there were any smart phones.

Now that I played around with it a bit, I find it so much fun to click and drag! I don't even have to give up the slide-out QWERTY.This phone WILL automatically add a $10/mo data plan to your phone.

I am going to confirm tomorrow and update this review again with a definitive answer (that is in writing).*** LATEST UPDATE: I just had a conversation with Verizon concerning this phone. According to the CSR I spoke with, and confirmed by his supervisor, when you activate this phone, they will automatically add a $9.99 data plan that covers 75MB of data. However, you can request that the data plan be removed and that a data block be placed on the phone.The latest information satisfies my concerns and I have requested that the seller rescind my cancellation request and ship the phone.

Unfortunately Verizon doesn't offer much in the way of basic or multimedia phones so I had to buy this used. I would have gave this five stars but the phone sticks when I slide it open.

I am severely disappointed with this product especially since I spent over hundred something dollars on such an up to date phone. There had to be something that went wrong with this phone with a previous owner or the previous damage done was not fixable or even able to be hidden. I am severely disappointed and would like to have a refund, but there is no point. I don't want another phone from this seller because I no longer trust this seller. I have bought phones before from Amazon among other sellers on this website, and I have never ever had one single problem or glitch happen with any of the phones I've ever bought. I am very upset and now my mother is left without a phone because of poor service and an untrustworthy seller.",4

It does have a $10/month data plan with my Verizon plan but the internet on this phone is almost useless. It like the internet on all phones over 10 years ago before there were any smart phones.

So now I need to buy one with a different adaptor. Also for some reason it won't find my bluetooth but maybe that's operator error.

"Samsung Reality SCH-U820 Phone, City Red (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,19.33,2,"The construction quality of this phone is horrible. The first one we got just stopped working one day. Probably the digitizer, because it would charge and turn on but the screen was unresponsive making the phone mostly useless. The people we ordered from were excellent and replced the unit, and that one worked until my daughter dropped it and the digitizer came off. I purchased a replacement digitizer, which is a pain to install, but it worked for a little while. My opinion is that the digitizer cable does not attach securely enough. You slide it into a slot and it just sits there, and if it doesn't stay in the slot properly there is no contact and the darn screen is no longer responsive. Based on the number of forum complaints, I'd say this is a common problem. My advice...look for another phone, especially if you are not comfortable taking apart electronics",0
"Samsung Reality SCH-U820 Phone, City Red (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,19.33,3,"this phone works great when it's working. great call quality, fast image processing, intuitive menu system, and a surprisingly high quality screen resolution to boot. however, drop it once, and the entire touch screen will come loose and fall out of the casing. it's quite a strange sight to see, and it can be up to a $45-$75 repair when it happens. and if it happens once, it will happen again even more easily than the first time.summary: excellent phone for someone who does not quite need a smart phone, but if you buy it, you simply MUST purchase a hard protective case that will help hold the screen in place.

Samsung Rogue U960 CDMA phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract,Samsung,19.99,4,"My son really seems to like this. We searched high and low for the smartest dumb-phone we could find. He really liked this one so we picked it up. So far after about a month of use he's pretty happy with it. One of the things he really wanted was a great MP3 player. Unfortunately this isn't as good as my Kin for playing MP3s but it's serviceable. Unlike my Kin there are actually a few games on this phone so he likes that about it. I was surprised to see how many smartphone features had been incorporated into this phone. The ability to add shortcuts to the home screen is very smartphoneish and makes the phone easier to use. He wishes he could add the music player as a shortcut to the desktop or add specific albums to the desktop but the phone doesn't support it.He has had the phone lock up multiple times. It appears to happen a couple times a week at least. He often turns the phone off rather than just silencing it when he's in a place he shouldn't receive a call so the phone gets rebooted regularly. It's a bit surprising to me that it still crashes so often.You might wonder why I give it 4 stars despite these failings. It's really because it's one of the best dumbphones I've seen. Granted, compared to a Windows Phone, Android or iPhone this one doesn't even rate 2 stars but if you're trying to avoid the phone company's exorbitant monthly fees for the privilege of using a smartphone on their network then this is a good middle-ground. I like my Kin better than the Rogue (I'd give it 5 stars in the non-smartphone category) but my Windows Phone is FAR better than the Kin.",0

Beautiful interface, takes voice commands and easy to set up (comes with a wizard that holds your hand.)Got a case for it for protection and don't think it will require an extra battery. It seems to last a while.Not a heavy phone, but not light either. Feels like you're holding a phone, not a toy. I like it.Nice camera and a dedicated voice command (hard) button. Like the fact that the app dock can hide if you want it to.

Samsung Rogue U960 CDMA phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract,Samsung,19.99,2,"Downgrading from Samsung Galaxy S to cancel a seldom used data plan; I was looking for a phone primarily for calling, texting, playing music and taking pictures. I've been using the phone for two months now.Pros: Acceptable call quality, nice keypad, good battery lifeCons: Horrible, horrible touch screen, cheap construction that is easily scratched and gouged, useless ""lock"" button on the side, menu system is mediocrePrevious phones tried: HTC Droid Eris, Samsung Galaxy S, Motorola Droid XPrimarily due to the terrible touchscreen, I've had a miserable time with this phone. Much of the interface, and almost all of the feature extras included with the phone depend on this touch screen, and getting that to function properly has been maddening. The screen will either sense no touch, or completely misinterpret the input and register too many touches in all the wrong directions. Tried the built-in calibration tool several times, never with any benefit.Dropped the phone onto the pavement once while getting into the car, a trivial plop to the ground. Result - a surprising number of gouges and scrapes. Both my other smart phones suffered ten times worse (at the hands of my two-year-old) with barely any scratches. Gorilla glass this is NOT.Side button to lock the phone also UNLOCKS it if pressed two times, so pocket dialing is easy and frequent. Little thought went into some of the design features.Two stars simply because it does function adequately as a phone. The rest of the phone is worthless due to the poor touch interface. Maybe others with the right fingers will have better luck.",2

The touchscreen is sorta hard to press at first, especially compared to modern smartphones. But after a while of use it's not bad! The thing I dislike the most about it is that it does not have T9word for the QWERTY board, which I like to use as an autocorrect, and it does not automatically capitalize ""I"" or other proper nouns/names. The keyboard on the touchscreen is in ABC form, not QWERTY form like on most touchscreens.

I don't need the other fancy stuff. Just the basics and this phone is great. Sturdy phone. I don't feel I have to be overly careful holding it. Plus, if it does break, it's not hundreds of dollars to replace.The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it says it's a Verizon phone.

Samsung Rogue U960 CDMA phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract,Samsung,19.99,5,"My wife wanted a phone that was a Swiss army knife, but didn't need a smart phone. After much research, I found the Rogue. This device has so many bells and whistles on it plus a slide-out keyboard. Beautiful interface, takes voice commands and easy to set up (comes with a wizard that holds your hand.)Got a case for it for protection and don't think it will require an extra battery. It seems to last a while.Not a heavy phone, but not light either. Feels like you're holding a phone, not a toy. I like it.Nice camera and a dedicated voice command (hard) button. Like the fact that the app dock can hide if you want it to. The four icons on the bottom of the display stay there, but the side dock that scrolls can disappear at a click.Very bright and colorful display - easy to see. Highly customizable. She loves it.",

Samsung Rogue U960 CDMA phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract,Samsung,19.99,4,"My son really seems to like this. We searched high and low for the smartest dumb-phone we could find. He really liked this one so we picked it up. So far after about a month of use he's pretty happy with it. One of the things he really wanted was a great MP3 player. Unfortunately this isn't as good as my Kin for playing MP3s but it's serviceable. Unlike my Kin there are actually a few games on this phone so he likes that about it. I was surprised to see how many smartphone features had been incorporated into this phone. The ability to add shortcuts to the home screen is very smartphoneish and makes the phone easier to use. He wishes he could add the music player as a shortcut to the desktop or add specific albums to the desktop but the phone doesn't support it.He has had the phone lock up multiple times. It appears to happen a couple times a week at least. He often turns the phone off rather than just silencing it when he's in a place he shouldn't receive a call so the phone gets rebooted regularly. It's a bit surprising to me that it still crashes so often.You might wonder why I give it 4 stars despite these failings. It's really because it's one of the best dumbphones I've seen. Granted, compared to a Windows Phone, Android or iPhone this one doesn't even rate 2 stars but if you're trying to avoid the phone company's exorbitant monthly fees for the privilege of using a smartphone on their network then this is a good middle-ground. I like my Kin better than the Rogue (I'd give it 5 stars in the non-smartphone category) but my Windows Phone is FAR better than the Kin.",0

Samsung Rogue U960 CDMA phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract,Samsung,19.99,4,"As a comparison to the Samsung Rogue I have an LG env3 that I've been using for the past several months and consider about the best phone I've ever had. I had a chance to try out the Rogue for about three weeks and like it nearly as much as the env3.ProsThe screen is clear and bright. The slide out keyboard has a good response. I like it a lot more than the one on the Droid I used to have, but not as much as my env3. The ""back"" button at the bottom of the phone is super handy. I really liked the scroll feature in Contacts. As you drag down, a large letter appears indicating where you are in your contact list. This feature works better than the one on my Droid. Contacts are easy to edit and the list makes it easy to text or call. The colors used in the messages display made them easy to read through. The sound quality of the phone and hands free are acceptable. The controls on the sides of the phone were usable. I like the way you can pin certain often-used features to the screen and the side tab where you can select other often-used features to dock there for quick access. Permanent buttons for dialer, contacts, messages, menu are conveniently located at the bottom of the screen.ConsWith a plastic cover the phone's a little on the bulky side, but about what you'd expect for the price. The touch screen failed to respond to my desired selection about 15% of the time. I expect this would improve as I got used to it more. The screen would occasionally unlock itself, but it never pocket dialed.OtherThe camera was acceptable for the price of this phone, but the buttons and settings were not exactly intuitive and would take some getting used to. Pictures look great on the screen and there are several ways to display them. The notes feature is acceptable, but the length limit is short, and I didn't find a way to organize the notes in the order I wanted and they can't be stored on a micro SD card. I didn't try the music feature or the voice commands feature (for which there are buttons on the side of the phone).",

How many struggles that phone passed trough, but he never fails me, he always works even when it was broken, amazingly I kept using it to pass the order to my company, but for them, I have to give it back the way they gave it to me, not broken. And at this wonderful price, no way I,m going to pay $150 to my company.

Samsung Rugby 2 A847 Unlocked GSM Ruggedized Phone PTT GPS 3G,Samsung,39.24,5,"I recently purchased the Samsung Rugby 2 flip phone and am very happy with it. I bought it after researching the phone online. I found that it is very durable, complies to military standards, is shock resistant, rain resistant, etc. I only use the phone for phone calls and texting. I did not need the features of a smart phone, nor do I like paying $75. or $100. a month for a cell phone. I have AT&T ""Pay As You Go"" plan which I have had for the last 5 years. I pay $25. every 3 months and have never run out of minutes, its basically 10 cents a minute. Think about it, $8.33 a month! If my minutes do run low, I can always add more minutes if I need in any increment I want, $10. $15. etc. and they do rollover.The best feature of the Samsung Rugby 2 phone is the call quality. Every review I read mentioned this and it is true, it never drops a call and the call quality is remarkable. Samsung has done a great job building a rugged phone. The phone costs $265.00 retail from AT&T without a contract. I was able to find it on Amazon, brand new, unlocked, for $125.00. A great deal! The only way to get it cheaper is buy it through AT&T with a 2 year contract for $99.00.",38

After hours of technical support from Fido (Canadian Service provider), Samsung, and AT&T, I have been unable to do anything but send and receive phone calls. Nobody can help me input the new service provider info to maximize all uses of the phone. Of course, it's impossible to get Fido, Samsung, and AT&T talking the same language and talking together to help. We may be able to put a rover on Mars, but nobody can get this phone to work, it's just a bridge too far. If you want to use this phone for any carrier other than AT&T, you might as well buy a $10 throw away.

I only have to charge it once every week and that is great. The ptt button, on the outside, however, is really annoying and it is a serious design flaw if it turns out that this cannot be deactivated or disengaged or whatever, as some people, myself included, get rugged phones so they can be worn while doing rugged work, and this button gets pressed at least five thousand times a day accidentally. I have yet to really attempt to do anything about this. Also it stinks that it doesn't say who is texting you so you have to open the phone instead of just looking at it. This phone is worth the forty five bucks I paid for it.",1

Samsung Rugby 2 A847 Unlocked GSM Ruggedized Phone PTT GPS 3G,Samsung,39.24,5,I am on my third Samsung Rugby flip phone. The first two were unfortunate victims of washing machine suicides.I work in construction and this phone really holds up to the rough conditions it is exposed to. It's great for me because it is so compact and I like the flip phones because they fold up to protect the screen. Also it is MUCH cheaper to purchase the phones through Amazon than the ATT stores where I bought my first 2 and I didn't have to extend my contract with ATT. I'll probably get another for a back up in case of another washing machine incident. It seems flip phones are becoming a thing of the past and are increasingly hard to find,1

Samsung Rugby 2 A847 Unlocked GSM Ruggedized Phone PTT GPS 3G,Samsung,39.24,5,"I've had this phone a month now, and it's everything I expected. I have a Company smart-phone, but I needed something a lot simpler to use as my personal phone. I do not text on it, nor do I have a data plan. I only use it as a phone - pure and simple. I'm a senior citizen and like the large keys and the large screen fonts it uses when phone numbers are being typed in. I've also managed to drop it onto a concrete sidewalk several times, and like the old Timex watches, it takes a licking and keeps on ticking. It's one tough little phone. I keep it in my back pocket or front shirt pocket, and it stays put without slipping out (its case seems to grip the fabric a lot better than my old hard-plastic Nokia phone). I chose the Rugby 2 over the Rugby 3, because the Rugby 2 is a lot smaller and lighter. The Rugby 3 is large and heavy, because it has a bigger battery in it. I'm not a teenage girl, so I don't need the extra hours worth of talk time that the Rugby 3 will give you. Since this phone is ""unlocked"", I simply removed my old SIM card from my broken AT&T Nokia phone and inserted it into my Rugby 2. Worked like a champ with no re-connection problems. One note before going: the User's Guide that comes in the box is the ""condensed"" version' be sure to download the full User's Guide from Samsung, or you will go crazy trying to figure our some of the phone's features. Would I recommend it to my (older) friends? You bet I would!",3

Second one got so quiet, I reset it to the code supplied on the internet. This worked ONCE, but when volume went down the 2nd time, I gave up.

There is a dedicated button on the top left side for ""PTT"" a built in feature ""Push To Talk"". It is a subscription based walkie-talkie like option.

As it comes in the box, the functioning of the PTT button cannot be changed or disabled (maybe by rooting the phone, which is something I didn't want to do.)Also, the ringer wasn't loud enough for my taste. I paid the return postage and returned it.",6

How many struggles that phone passed trough, but he never fails me, he always works even when it was broken, amazingly I kept using it to pass the order to my company, but for them, I have to give it back the way they gave it to me, not broken. And at this wonderful price, no way I,m going to pay $150 to my company.

I only have to charge it once every week and that is great. The ptt button, on the outside, however, is really annoying and it is a serious design flaw if it turns out that this cannot be deactivated or disengaged or whatever, as some people, myself included, get rugged phones so they can be worn while doing rugged work, and this button gets pressed at least five thousand times a day accidentally. I have yet to really attempt to do anything about this. Also it stinks that it doesn't say who is texting you so you have to open the phone instead of just looking at it.

I bought it after researching the phone online. I found that it is very durable, complies to military standards, is shock resistant, rain resistant, etc. I only use the phone for phone calls and texting. I did not need the features of a smart phone, nor do I like paying $75. or $100. a month for a cell phone. I have AT&T ""Pay As You Go"" plan which I have had for the last 5 years. I pay $25. every 3 months and have never run out of minutes, its basically 10 cents a minute. Think about it, $8.33 a month! If my minutes do run low, I can always add more minutes if I need in any increment I want, $10. $15. etc. and they do rollover.The best feature of the Samsung Rugby 2 phone is the call quality. Every review I read mentioned this and it is true, it never drops a call and the call quality is remarkable. Samsung has done a great job building a rugged phone. The phone costs $265.00 retail from AT&T without a contract. I was able to find it on Amazon, brand new, unlocked, for $125.00. A great deal!

Nobody can help me input the new service provider info to maximize all uses of the phone. Of course, it's impossible to get Fido, Samsung, and AT&T talking the same language and talking together to help. We may be able to put a rover on Mars, but nobody can get this phone to work, it's just a bridge too far.

It works well very good reception and has great battery life. it is also the most rugged phone I have owned. It was used and really beat up looking when I got it but also really cheap. I however did super glue the PTT and the silly speaker buttons. I also live in a area of high crime and less than a mile from my home a young man was killed this year for his smartphone....No one would bother to steal this beat up cheap looking phone!

Only problem is that AT&T software is DEEPLY embedded into the firmware, and so if you want to use it for T-mobile (as I do) or other GSM providers, be prepared to use it strictly for phone calls and texts (and photos, though the camera is anemic at best) . No GPS, No internet, no email, not unless you have AT&T service. I did find a hack online to make the internet browser to work, but it was a pain in the rear. Unless you can find a custom ROM for this thing (which I couldn't), you're stuck with mostly a cell phone (Which might be OK for many of you). As far as T-mobile calls go, the phone was in fact ""unlocked"" and all i needed to do is pop in my simcard. Battery life is quite good also.",5

It's simple and you can customize the font size and number colors on the screen which makes it easy to see. Samsung hasn't changed the button layout that much so it was familiar to her.

Samsung Rugby 3 A997 GSM Unlocked Rugged Flip Phone - Dark Gray,Samsung,104.95,4,"Finally received this phone after an Amazon Prime shipping fiasco (in fact,my Amazon account still reflects that I haven't received it). The phone is better than I expected. It feels fairly rugged and seems as if it could withstand a drop or two. The hinge is much more sturdy than other flip phones I've had. Texting on flip phones is usually a pain, but the majority of buttons on this one make it quite a bit less painless. Perhaps one of the best features is its battery. It holds a charge like no other phone I've ever had.After initially getting it, I put in my old sim and it started right up. It came with an almost fully charged battery. The box was also slightly damaged but didn't affect the phone. So somewhere in the back of my mind, I do wonder a little if this was used before, though it was sold as new.I don't use the web features or the PTT, so I can just speak to its basic phone qualities. The only two things I don't care for: one of the buttons is small enough that I often hit the ""C"" button and have to start over and I do not like the access piece to the charging port. Seems like that part won't last. It is by far my favorite flip phone. It is not pretty",0

Initial 2-3 days, reception was bad but now it is very good.edit: It takes many more rings before this phone starts to ring. I haven't been getting some calls that I expected, because I think the caller is thinking I am not picking up. First time I started testing this phone, sometimes it took up to 40 seconds before I called this phone (from my fios connected home phone).

PTT button handy if on ATT but gets in the way while picking up phone activating Push to talk feature which of course doesn't work on CC. same for GPS button as it only works on ATT.

Samsung Rugby 3 A997 GSM Unlocked Rugged Flip Phone - Gray/Black (International Version),Samsung,89.49,5,"I received this phone yesterday. Even though it says it is used, it came in original packaging and the stickers were still on the back of the phone. The battery was fully charged when it arrived. Inside the package was a note from the seller asking me to contact them if I had any problems and they would be happy to make it right. I've bought a lot of stuff from Amazon and that was the first personal note from a seller. It was impressive. The phone is in excellent condition. It looks brand new. I don't use the internet on my phone so I cannot speak to that. I already had At&t as my carrier so I have no idea about the locked or unlocked state of the phone. I transferred my sim card and turned it on. Good to go. What I can say is that the phone I replaced was an original rugby that I have used for over five years. I never had any trouble with it until recently. The camera and the speaker were going bad. I checked At&t for a replacement phone. This phone was cheaper by far, plus I didn't have to renew my contract or pay a $36 fee to upgrade it. This phone has all the same features of the original, probably more I just haven't really looked, so it's easy for me to use, and the speaker is fantastic. It rings loud enough on the highest setting that even I with my not so perfect hearing can hear it from across the house. I can hear calls perfectly without having to put them on speaker phone. It is a rugby so I know that it can take a licking and keep on going. If you want a phone for talk and text that will last through the oopses of life, this is the best one on the market. I look forward to many years of service from my new phone. I will also recommend the seller to my friends.",42

(The Rugby can take alot, but the heat of the dryer definately fried the screens and connections). Purchase arrived within expected time period. We have ATT, and if purchased from them, the same phone would have cost $260.00. All we had to do was pop the old sim card in the new phone and we were in business! Thanks Amazon and Ross Cellular.

I switched to a simpler plan with a basic phone and am saving loads. But none of that has anything to do with the phone. The phone itself is great! I HAD an original Rugby when they came out and I loved it! So when I decided to switch from the iPhone there was only one logical choice; the Rugby III.

The battery last for just about a week and that is with 4 alarms set to remind me to take my pills.

Samsung Rugby 3 A997 GSM Unlocked Rugged Flip Phone - Gray/Black (International Version),Samsung,89.49,1,"Before a couple years ago, flip phones were all I had. Then I had a few smart phones, and decided it was time to get myself a flip phone again and leave all the things I did not like about the smart phones behind. I was rather ecstatic while looking for one, and I decided this one, since its unlocked (I have T Mobile) and has a lot of the features I liked with the smart phone such as gps, browser, and weather information. I have had it about 20 days and now I am returning it.-From the start, I found out because I have T Mobile, the gps, browser, and weather information (and all the other stuff really besides the phone itself and calls and texts) did not work. So I paid for a phone for stuff that would be useful for me that I could not use. I talked to the tech reps a couple of times to see if they could do anything about it and their ideas did not do it; although, I do highly recommend T Mobile's customer service. I decided to keep the phone because I felt it still had much to offer.-On top of that, I saved all my contacts from my other phone into a backup file and when I tried transferrering it to this phone, this phone could not read the file format. So I typed up all my contact info into a document on my computer, and then put the 200 of them manually into my phone. Since I am quite busy, this took several days to do after work.-Another issue I had, is that I could not plug my phone via usb cable into my computer to transfer pictures or what not to it, so I had to take the SD card out of it manually, but it into my computer, and do that, which required me to take off the back cover, shut down my phone, and pull the battery anytime I wanted to do it. On top of that, it would not charge through the cable to my computer, only the home outlet would do it. My computer did not see that the phone was plugged into it at all.-It was also slow, I have pictures of past work I have done I like to look at and learn from, make improvements in my head and what not. Some of the file formats it would not read so I could not see them, but really, it just toke a very long time to scroll through them all, and then by name - once I found the one I was looking for, it would take another 10-15 seconds on top of that to load the picture so that I could see what it was. The screen, though I knew it was going to be small when I bought the phone, leaves a lot to be desired when coming from a smart phone.-Another concern, it said 15 day battery life standby time. I do not doubt that, however, when I am on the phone, I would get maybe 4-5 hours total talk time before the battery would die. My last smart phone (cheapest thing I could get) I could talk for about 8-10 hours. Which is a very noticeable difference,-It had sub-standard reception most of the time. And when it looses reception, it makes beeps until you get reception again, and it asks you the entire time you do not have reception, it wants to know if you would like to select a network. This is all fine, it is just annoying and should do it on its own. The real problem is that it hardly ever has reception. Since it beeps at you when there is no reception, and it does not have reception often, it makes for quite the annoying experience. My phone was always on vibrate because of that.-Lastly, and why I am returning it is because it now has the white screen of death. I took it out of my pocket to check the time and about two seconds later, bam, white screen. I turned off the phone and shut it off and pulled the battery and all that, still, nothing. I do get a second or so of the screen working then it goes to white screen. The back screen looks like it would if the screen got damaged, but that is the lighting, and when the screens are off, there are no damages anywhere. And the backlite screen itself works for a second fine then shows that lighting effect after the second. I dont know what to think. But overall, it is quite upsetting. I will mention, the phone still works, I just cant see anything. So I am returning it. Going to get a new battery for my Razr.-Conclusion: I guess, with todays electronics technology, I was hoping for a flip phone that acted similarly to a smart phone in how it opperates, but left out all the ""smart, data-like"" stuff of the smart phones. Becaue off the grid is kind of nice, it just is a pain. I felt this phone had a lot to offer for a smart phone, but I could not use it because of my service provider. To me though, even if its gps and what not was able to work, I doubt it would have been usefull because it is just a pain to do anything. Perhaps for some people, this is okay, but I am going to go a different route.",1

Samsung Rugby 3 A997 GSM Unlocked Rugged Flip Phone - Gray/Black (International Version),Samsung,89.49,2,"Do not like this phone! We recently switched to AT&T from Verizon and my wife and son got smartphones. I like flip phones because they fit in my pocket and I don't have to worry about sitting on them, and quite frankly, I don't want to be ""connected"". I just want it to make phone calls and send the occasional text. I bought this phone because it was the closest thin I could find to my Motorola VU204, which I loved. So' some specifics: The navigation is awkward. The center button on the navigation pad brings up the web interface, which is really annoying because the phone is not enabled for that. The navigation pad is too small, I am used to navigating with my thumb and I'm costantly hitting the buttons that surround the navigation pad, and I have small hands. I have not found the menu structure to be at all intuitive and I am constantly navigating to places I don't want to go. After 6 months I still have trouble simply replying tp a text! Voice commands, you have to navigate through 4 menus to be able to use voice dialing. It's like, why bother? Isn't the whole Idea of voice commands so that you don't have to be looking at the phone? 10 digit dialing. When I Call or send a text the phone only recognizes 10 digits, If I use 7 digits, it will make a local call, but not recognize the number as one from my contacts, it will not accept a 7 digit number for a text. There is a soft key on the side which accesses PTT, evidently a service for which you pay extra which allows you to use the phone as a Walkie-Talkie, kind of like the Old Sprint flip phones. I could go on and on, but the bottom line is I was looking for a basic albiet rugged phone similar to my Motorola VU204. This is not it.A note on delivery. Unit was shipped the same day and I had it in 2. The phone was in pristine condition with all of the parts and pieces listed. No gripes with product quality, service or delivery.",0

Samsung Rugby 3 A997 GSM Unlocked Rugged Flip Phone - Gray/Black (International Version),Samsung,89.49,2,"I bought this for my husband because he is very hard on his phones and either loses them or breaks them and our phone plan insurance would have cost me double what I paid for this.As far as working, it works great but for some reason some of our Samsung charges do not work on it and found out the hard phone with a dead battery all day. Even though it fits the part you put it on some of the chargers are just not long enough. (not sure why some are a little longer than others ?)Also I didn't get a manual with it so my husband has a hard time doing what he needs to other than making a call. Pictures are not very good and are so small hard to see what you are looking at. I tried texting from his phone and I don't know if its because I have a smart phone much more updated but I had a hard time figuring out how to reply to a text - kind of weird and you have to actually save every picture before you can take another so there is no taking more than one pic at a time, especially the first few times trying to even figure out how to save it. It seems to be more trial and error finding out how to do things on it because its definitely not user friendly.",2

Samsung Rugby 3 A997 GSM Unlocked Rugged Flip Phone - Gray/Black (International Version),Samsung,89.49,5,"Had one of the first Rugby phones and loved it. This one not as ""beefy"" but not as ugly either (no construction-zone yellow). It's definitely cat proof which is all I ask. The volume at highest setting was still weak... until I figured it out. Can't hear it? Just go into Settings, Sound Profile, and switch to ""Outdoor"" mode - voila - and leave it there. It's much louder. Downloading ringtones to PC for loading onto the Rugby required installation of Samsung's Kies software but, once installed, made getting alternate ringtones onto the phone a breeze. Now, every time my phone rings, I hear the tripods from War of The Worlds (the remake), and it's generally appropriate. The Rugby works with Consumer Cellular if you're like me and restrict your phone usage to talk and text. Outside of AT&T, it is not a ""palmtop"" computer. Some of us refuse to get one of those anyway - like our browsing on 24"" screens. If you're addicted and not with AT&T, this won't be the phone for you. If you want a good, durable, and reliable ""phone"" that you can count on for years to come and that has awesome standby and talk time, then it is... definitely. I've yet to find a phone that can squeeze hours out of a battery change like a Samsung, and every Samsung phone I've had has averaged a two-year battery life. I grin every time a coworker's or friend's phone poops out on them. Hey, they went for pretty and all those bells and whistles, but it's rather sad when they're paying that much for phone service yet constantly unable to make a call. I just have to remember to charge mine at least once a week. As a phone, I couldn't recommend it more. As a computer? Well, go get one of those instead.",0

This is an AT&T branded phone; an AT&T logo, packed and shipped in an AT&T box but unlocked, so it takes anyone's SIM (think outside the US). As an AT&T product any accessories included with the phone are at the discretion of AT&T. Mine included an earbuds headset, which is okay unless you wear hearing aids, as I do. Earbuds for the hearing-impaired are useless. Interestingly, the owner's manual includes a picture of what AT&T calls a ""MicroUSB to 3.5mm converter,"" a device that permits the use of a headset with that size audio plug. Why AT&T omitted the converter even though the manual says it is included with the phone only AT&T can answer. They could have included both and addressed the needs of both the hearing-impaired and those with normal hearing. Go figure. A quick email to Ross brought the device at no charge.

Problem is, he remodels houses all day and all his past phones have met tragic demises off ladders, tailgates, etc. I watched him drop this phone onto the floor from a 6' ladder while trying to dig it out of his pocket to answer a call. I reached down and answered it (I know that isn't the only time it has been dropped). His favorite thing to do is turn on the speaker so he can continue working while talking to you. It is reasonably clear and loud on both sides of the call (unless he forgets and walks to the other side of the room). The interface is pretty simple and straight forward, but the phone has a good amount of features. Does it have all the modern bells and whistles, no and that's the point.

Works well, better built than the cheap little $10 and $20 dollar phones that my dad had been buying to use with his T-Mobile sims card. He was replacing his phone every few weeks.

It was received days before promised and with a SIM and memory card swap I logged in to the carrier phone network and it worked. However when I tried to customize the contact list there was a password assigned. I contacted the seller and they did not know it and as it was previously owned, had no way to find out what it may be either. SUPER SELLER.

Phone was supposed to be Yellow and Black but I received, much to my pleasent surprise, the black one.I needed an unlocked GSM phone to replace my old tried and true Sanyo Pro 200 that was a CDMA phone on the Platinumtel network. They updated to GSM and sadly I couldn't use the Sanyo anymore.Despite the AT&T logo that comes up when powered on.. it is indeed unlocked and accepted the Sim card without issue from PTel.I desire in a phone that it be fairly sturdy, a flip style, that it makes decent calls, doesn't require puzzle solving skills to use and has a battery that lasts more than a day or two. This one sounded like it would fit the bill and so far it has.I didn't think I'd find another phone that pleased me as much as the Sanyo did, but this one has been great!Calls are extremely clear.Accessories can be found cheaply. I wish it had come with a plastic belt holster like the sanyo did, but I've found and ordered one that is supposed to go with it.Update 6/29/2015: Phone is still going strong on original battery.

"Samsung S30 SPH-M810 Instinct 2, Brown (Sprint) CDMA - No Contract Required",Samsung,40,1,"Probably the lousiest phone I've ever owned. My son's phone died but we weren't due for an upgrade on his line for over a year so I purchased this one as a bandaid. Know what? A bandaid probably would have functioned better as a phone, than this phone did.The touch/swipe interface was MISERABLE - you had to press or swipe so hard just to get the thing to answer a call or change functions/menu screens.It wouldn't hold a charge for nothin'! Even in my son's backpack while at school, ie not being used, it would be dead by 2nd period.It turned itself off at will, and sometimes at a most inopportune time!Every 3 weeks or so, this little peach of a phone decided to wipe out all the contacts and stored messages/media. You'd pick it up to make a call, and realize that everything was GONE. It did this more times than I could keep count of.Obviousy, this phone did NOT serve us even mildly well, which was a shock to me for a Samsung. I've always liked their products and we have Samsungs all around right now that we love. But this one? Sorry to say, it's a total dud. We laid the smackdown on it after only a few months, when we just couldn't take its miserable antics anymore!",0

It did ship on the 4th of the 3 to 5 day business shipping days so that was good.

Samsung S5230 Hello Kitty Pink Unlocked GSM QuadBand Cell Phone,Samsung,79,2,"This phone is okay. I got it for my thirteenth birthday a couple months ago. At first I liked it, but it got old REALLY fast. It doesn't have threaded messaging like I would have hoped. The touch screen is fine. Not too sensitive. Camera is okay. Kinda blury :/. The side keyboard is bad. I usually just use the T9 mode when I text. Not many text tones to choose from. About four. One good thing is that you can use recordings as ringtones. Good vibriation for the most part. One thing that pissed me off is that you have to like email T-mobile to actually send and recieve picture messages and the like. It was a HUGE hassle! Good radio and reception. Cute outisde. It is also VERY SMALL. Also, it hasn't froze up yet, but would NOT be surprised if it did. It's good for younger girls that want a cute, touchscreen phone, but for older girls/teenagers/women, it's not a good phone. Maybe try the LG unlocked Xenon cell phone. I'm looking into it.",3

Samsung S5230 Hello Kitty Pink Unlocked GSM QuadBand Cell Phone,Samsung,79,1,when i first received this phone i fell in love with it. I had the phone for about a month it started messing up. My calls would drop even when I had great service. If I would talk longer than 2 minutes it would sound like there was water in my phone and the phone was nor had been near any water. I contacted the company on this problem. They told to contact Samsung but when i contacted the company again and told them that Samsung couldn't help me they would not reply back to any of my emails.

And you also have to re-size picture that you've taken to send to individual. You can't text while in a conversation with someone or surf the net, kinda weird but that's how the phone operate.

Samsung S5230 Hello Kitty Pink Unlocked GSM QuadBand Cell Phone,Samsung,79,5,"This Hello Kitty special edition of the Samsung star is just amazing! from the great call quality to the screen resolution, I highly recomend this phone. I recieved the phone within the alloted time period, and when I started her up...surprise! The start-up info was in German! No problem, Thanks to the wonders of Google, I found exact translation instructions on a blogging website. I do not utilize the internet portion of the phone, as I am a prepaid utilizer and will not waste my hard earned money on cellphone phooey! I use my IPOD touch for that. anyways, It is well packaged and comes with a Euro-style plug with US adaptation, which is aewsome. It is a bit smaller that it appears to be online, which was a good thing, as I slip it into a pocket and don't have to worry about a big bulky thing disturbing my sitting position!! So, If you are procrastinating, just stop right there, get this phone! You'll be glad you did!",8

Samsung S5230 Hello Kitty Pink Unlocked GSM QuadBand Cell Phone,Samsung,79,5,I got this phone to replace my old iPhone. I did not originally think this phone would be as good. I just received it today and I have to say I like even better then my old iPhone. It was easy to switch it to English and set up just the way I wanted it. It was also easy to import my music and pictures from my computer onto the phone using the USB cable and the software included. I also liked that the seller included an adapter for the charger so I can use it in the US (since the charger is a European one). Earphones for listening to music and stuff were included as well which is good since the outlet is different than the standard so I think it would have been hard to find ones that went. It is also light weight and small enough to be easy to fit in a purse or pocket with a screen that is big enough to see everything. Plus it being Hello Kitty really adds to the cute factor. I recommend this phone who wants a cute little phone that is really practical with a lot of cool features for a good price.,18

I went to my service provider and they fixed everything! It has been a really fun phone, I love the radio and mp3 player. I highly suggest buying a stylus, it makes it much easier to use! Also plan on buying memory-you can't use the mp3 player or the computer software without it. Memory can be bought pretty cheap here in amazon. Overall I love it, I get compliments on it all of the time and because it wasn't released here in America, it is very unique!",36

I do wish that I had been able to read the instruction manuel-was unable to due to the fact that it was not written in English, however, have been able to figure out most of the features. The call quality is fine and I was able to send and receive txts right away. I am not able to send or receive pic txts or send pics to my email, but I hope that my provider will be able to help me with this problem when I take it in. The battery does not seem to last as long as my last phone (a motorola), but I am enjoying the touch screen and am pleased with the camera quality. I did run into a problem a couple days after I got this phone-I was getting an ""insert sim"" message even though I had a sim card in, but figured out that this was due to the fact that the back was on a little loosely and my sim card had slipped out of position. Once I fixed this I didn't have any more problems. The company I purchased from was very quick to respond when I tried to contact them-called AND emailed me the following business day but by then I had figured out and resolved the prob. I am very satisfied with this phone and would def purchase again. And it's so darn cute-I like the size, color, and design.",8
Samsung S5230 Hello Kitty Pink Unlocked GSM QuadBand Cell Phone,Samsung,79,5,I love this phone I read all the reviews and agree it is a cute girls phone. It came with the adapter and was in English.

Alternatively you can try to find a nice customer service rep at a ""real"" store, they'll do it for you. It's not one of their phones so some of their reps might say no (but it is your service plan, so they usually say yes).As far as the startup language goes, the instructions that came with my phone said to insert the SIM card first, prior to doing anything else to have it come up in English instead of German. I noticed that afterwards but knew enough German to find the right setting. If you don't have a year or two to study another language, this is a goog time to try Google translate...",9

Don't get me wrong, I am using Samsung Galaxy Note for myself and Samsung does make good phones, I think.....but this phone? (note that question mark). Let's put it this way.....Have I seen the actual phone with my own eyes, touched, and felt it, I would not have bought it--Ah, I relied on the reviews of the others too much (many times it works, this time it didn't). My verdict is......this phone is just not a good phone. Only good thing in this phone is battery life in my opinion. I gave it 3 stars because my daughter likes it (she is 9 yrs old).",0

Also wish it had wifi, but I probably wouldn't do much more than experiment. I just switched from overpriced Verizon account I've had for many years, to T-mobile monthly with unlimited data, so the wifi is no big deal. Besides the fact that I love cats, including Hello Kitty and pink is my favorite color, I think it's great to have an unlocked phone. This is first time a phone I paid for feels like it actually belongs to me and none of it's capabilities are blocked.

All I did was insert the sim card and called t-mobile who walked me through setting up the phone's web set up. I am having a hard time with web access though and using MMS. The phone won't allow me to use both, so I manually have to switch between mobile and MMS profiles. There may be a way to do this, but I haven't figured it out yet.

However that is not a big issue as we can always buy a Samsung charger in India.Before sending this as a gift, I wanted to try it and check how it works. This was our first Touch screen phone.

I'm not trying the internet as I don't have data plan here and there is no wi-fi in this phone. My cousin will try internet in India. hope fully it works good.

"Samsung S5230 Tocco Lite Unlocked Phone with Quad-Band GSM, 3 MP Camera and MicroSD Slot - International Version No Warranty (Noble Black)",Samsung,55.55,3,"Perhaps I'm spoiled, coming from a Nokia phone with its incredible ease of use interface, but this Samsung has been a total nightmare to figure out...and this is me being a longtime gadget geek who usually doesn't even bother to read owners' manuals for anything---TVs, computers, audio equipment, DVD players, MP3 players, VCRs, digital cameras, etc.This phone gets two stars mainly for its looks---the case and the screen. It seems to have been designed mainly for the bimbo market, people who just want to have a pretty phone in their hands. The owner's manual is a thin and horribly useless joke, most of it is about how to use the web browsing, mp3 player, and camera. Simple basic phone functions, like how to access the keypad during a call (for navigating voice menus) are totally ignored.In fact, when I first turned on the phone, it was in German---and there is nothing in the damn manual about how to change the language. I had to go to Google Translator and translate each and every icon and menu heading in order to figure it out! At least they could have been bright enough to have the default setting on English, which is after all THE international language!Similarly, there are no instructions on how to turn off the annoying keypad tones. I just kind of stumbled across it.I bought this phone mainly for its PDA functions, which are passable at best. I do like that it's much easier to do texting on this since you can get a full QWERTY touch keyboard when you turn it on its side. But overall the basic phone functions are severely neglected and ease of use is abysmal. I will give this phone another couple of days, if it doesn't finally ""click"" it'll be going back.UPDATE, 10/1/2010:Well, I have learned to live with this phone's many quirks and flaws. Which would have been a far easier/quicker process if the damn thing had come with a halfway decent owner's manual, sheesh. So I've changed my rating from 2 stars to 3.Basically this is a good phone for sending text messages. It is most certainly NOT much of a Palm Pilot replacement, that's for sure. Reception and voice quality are both decent.One thing that I noticed, and now have grown to tolerate, is how often the buttons and functions lag, especially on the touchscreen---about 2 to 3 times out of ten, you tap an onscreen icon and nothing happens the first or second or even third time, you just have to keep tapping it until the damn processor wakes the hell up and does what it's being told to do. Annoying as hell at first, but oh well, as Dostoyevsky famously wrote (he was in a gulag at the time, lol): ""Man can get used to anything."" That could well be the motto for this phone, heh.UPDATE: 8/26/2011Over a year later, it has held up well and now that I have resigned myself to this phone's limitations, I am finding that it does a passable job of being the PDA replacement that I orginally had in mind. How? Through the built in Calendar, mainly...I am able to make alarmed reminders for myself. That is the main reason I wanted it. Oh and the contacts list is reasonably detailed too, which isn't bad. But the main reason I am giving it a better review now is because I have decided against getting an iPhone, iPad, or even Android phone/pad for at least another year while waiting for that technology to mature and the prices to drop. In the meantime, this Samsung gets the most basic jobs done ok, I guess. Though if I had to do it all over again maybe I would've tried a Nokia, they usually have the most intuitive user interface out there.",11

The camera gives clear picture. So far, everything works just fine. The applications are simply amazing...I don't have to wait to get on my computer all the time, and oh, i love the fact that I skype with it. Highly recommended!!! I couldn't find any reviews when i was making my purchase. I hope this helps someone.Ok, so I've used this phone for 4months and this an update. It still works as I stated earlier, but it suddenly turns itself off and on. At first, I didnt bother because those didnt happen often but after a while it got annoying(note that this doesn't happen very often...say twice in a month.Sometimes, the network suddenly disappears and I have to pull out the battery and stick it back for the network to start working again, but I think this may be a network issue rather than a phone-related problem. Hey, if you're looking for a phone that does skype video call, this is not the phone. It does wonderful skype call but does not enable video calls. I don't expect any other thing to go wrong, and I'm retaining my rating because the phone is great. Btw, i copied this from an earlier review of this phone just so I'd stop getting the prompt to review this product. Apparently, this is my amazon-verified purchase, but i'd reviewed the same phone elsewhere.",4

It shows one bar when I connect to my very strong home wifi signal.2. the broswer is very hard to use if you do manage to connect, and very slow3. can't send picture messages without being connected to ""the network""4. people can't hear me, say my voice sounds garbled5, and probably the most annoying thing so far, is the phone locking automatically. It makes it incredibly difficult to use the keypad while on a call. I did not realize how often I did this until now. You have to keep pressing the unlock button every two seconds. And then after you enter the numbers (say during a voice mail call) and put the phone back up to your ear, you end up pressing numbers on the keypad with your ear. I have accidentally deleted a bunch of voice mails this way.6. since the phone is European, as well are the games on it, I am afraid to purchase any of the games, as I'm not sure if extra charges apply for international payment/money transfer.I wish I had just bought a simple flip phone.

It does pick up wifi because it is unlocked but the browser is horrible. Usually after about 3 minutes of browsing it would stop and give a memory error. When I called a customer service center the keypad wouldn't let me enter the menu options. The camera on this is horrible too, and many of the 'widgets' you can't download with just wifi. For just over 200 dollars you can get the LG Optimus T unlocked which supports the latest Androhid 2.2 Froyo with a great browser. Another stupid thing about this phone is that the head phone jack is propitiatory and is not the normal 3.5mm jack. Stay away from this stupid phone, get something android based.",2

However I HATE the fact that once i received the phone I found out that it wasn't an American phone! So now I have no phone because I somehow locked it and now I can't get it unlocked because I can't get a hold of the customer service in the country where my phone was made. American customer service tried to help me but had no luck. Also some of the Apps are in different languages that I cannot read and so I can't use them! Also when I got the phone it would let me receive picture messages but not send them and I had to get my mobile provider to send me a download so that I could send pictures. From now on I am just going to pay that much more to go into a store and buy one from them where I know for a fact that this stuff wont happen! Don't waste your time or MONEY!!!!,4

I was disappointed with browser and unnecessary question about loading pages from various servers. But the worst part is completely non-functional GPS. Only after I received he phone was I able to find info that the GPS feature is available in Czech Republic ONLY. No wonder I couldn't change the language used in GPS section. To make things worse, I could not even get GPS coordinates let alone my location shown on a map (despite using my funds for data transfers).The phone came loaded with some applications, most of which I do not need. The ones I would like to have (like gtalk, yahoo msgr, etc) I could not install. In general, it seems that the Samsung OS is pretty sucky and inflexible.I could not recommend a phone like this to anyone.

"Samsung S5620 Monte Unlocked Quad-Band GSM Phone with 3 MP Camera, Wi-Fi, gps navigation, E-Mail, Stereo Bluetooth--International Version With Warranty (Black)",Samsung,98,4,"With regrets, I'm returning the Samsung Monte because of sporadic network service issues. The unit I received would show three bars one minute and No Service a minute later without changing locations and using a SIM card that worked fine in other phones. After messing with it for a couple of weeks I was convinced it wasn't something I could fix with a software setting.Otherwise, the phone was pretty much exactly what I wanted. It was great having Wi-Fi available on the phone when wireless connections were available. I was able to use the Facebook and GMail apps. The Internet browser seemed slow but adequate. The interface took a little getting used to but there were certain features I liked. I have an HTC Incredible so I'm used to a good smartphone interface and although the Monte's screen was a bit more sluggish than the Incredible it was still a nice touchscreen. I did miss not having a full virtual keyboard but the T9 predictive text worked well with just the standard number/text pad. The text messages just had a standard inbox/outbox interface which was not as nice as the threaded message display of most higher-end phones. I liked the control I had between phone memory and the microSD card (purchased separately). I was able to add custom ringtones easily. The volume rocker on the side worked differently - at the home screen it would control the volume of the keypad sounds but not the actual ringtone volume - but profiles could be switched easily enough.I would have kept the phone if the network connection would have been more stable. My home doesn't have a strong signal anyway so perhaps someone living within a very strong signal area wouldn't notice the sporadic nature I witnessed. I really liked the phone and would definitely have kept it had the signal not been an issue.",1

I received it over the Labor Day Weekend and I spent all weekend (mostly) configuring this phone to work with AT&T's Network. I was successful. But recently, I have been trying to access the 3G capabilities of this phone, low and behold there is significant differences in the frequencies that are utilized by Europe and North America for 3G. Consequently, The phone's 3G functions most notably the video call can't be use in the US. Because the phone is set up for 900/2100 mhz and AT&T uses 850/1700/1900. Tmobile uses other frequencies that are not compatible w/ this phone. I am currently researching whether or not I can reconfigure this phone to the required frequencies.

There is a task bar for keypad but it wont acknowledge or accept the command to open the keypad. If anyone has any solution for this please answer to this email,0

I have been trying to call several times, at least someone picked up but answer at an unpleasant manner, I need to try to keep up the conversation to find out what's the problem with my phone, they always tend to find something to hung up on me. They said no phone left in stock to replace this, so I chose refund option. Throughout several calls, I've reach them roughly 4 times. They promised me for my return label, but, never happen. They said it suppose to be sent to my amazon account, but I checked and I got none. I did wait for 2 weeks and got NOTHING, NO RETURN LABEL as what they did promise me. I ended up spending another 20$ to buy a program on website to unlock this phone by myself. I thought my sister will be very much happy then, but, she found out that there's no full keyboard for her when she texts which is the main reason why I bought this phone, I thought it a must with this type of smart phone. Another big problem is that, this phone DON'T READ CARD although there's place to put the card in, it CAN NOT READ MEMORY CARD. I gave up, I don't want to call back again, too much promises not nothing have done. And about 2 weeks later, I got an email of the OEM shop for ""return label""... too late already unlocked and my sister already used it, unhappily, so much disappointment, wasting money and just ruin a big expectation for my sister birthday.",6

This is a great device requiring little tech skills for phone, camera, bluetooth, general setup and so forth; but if you want net, email and GPS be prepared for a little work (ulocked).

I would use this phone for around 5 days without needing a recharge. Wow! And I surf the web and use the camera as well.Wifi works flawlessly. In built apps for Twitter,Facebook and google is great. However Google app does not work with wifi.. May be google has it hard coded to work with data plan only. But you have a work around. You can down load gmail app which works with WiFi.There is a smark unlock feature with gesture unlock. I love it. All you have to do is write a pre-set letter(you decide which letter) on the screen with your finger and phone unlocks and dials the number to have set for that letter! Amazing.There are many gadgets to use like tip calculator, timer, social networking sites apps, music player, Youtube app, Dictionary(I love it), messenger, voice recorder etc.Phone has Image editor. So you can take a picture, edit it to make it look better and then directly upload the picture to Picasa, facebook or Flickr. You can upload vidoes directly to Youtube.

The manual is useless because it is also in another language. This is not advertised as such.

Still figuring out a way to get English versions of these...but it really does not matter to me...I can't really get lost in my little part of the world. Google maps works well enough to get directions to shops and stuff I haven't really been to before.The GPS works fine. It takes a while to lock on to about five or six satellites before it gives lat, long, and alt (alt changes fairly rapidly even if you stay still...may be inaccurate).The interface is fairly responsive. It did stick on me once, and slow up a couple of times. No touch screen qwerty is a slight disappointment (should have it in landscape in my opinion).A phone that works, has good reception, wi-fi, and a bunch of other neat features. A few minor issues.

The music player is pretty good - has no problem locating my music files (and I didn't have to indicate where to search). The GPS takes awhile to get going sometimes, but it does work (Note: use the supplied Google maps - trying to upgrade will back-level the program and make it not work.)There are some good apps, and the phone is pretty intuitive.

When it arrived, I popped in my SIM card and voila! Well, whatever the Portuguese word for voila is. The language was set to Portuguese and I had to fumble my way through the menus trying to find what I thought was a menu option. After fumbling for about 10 minutes, I had it switched to English and was off.This is a great little phone for a couple bills. I don't have to sign up for the contract, and I can kiss off AT&T and go to T-Mobile if it suits my fancy.The WiFi is awesome. It's sad that US carriers can get away with forcing defeatured phones down our throats and force us into outrageous data plans. Since I live in Mountain View, I get free WiFi within the city from Google, so I don't have too much of a need for a data plan when I can use the built in WiFi.The camera takes great pictures at 3.2 megapixels. Video quality is good as well with a decent frame rate, but not the highest resolution (QVGA). Good enough for YouTube or Facebook.Voice quality is not the best. Also, I had to go to the UK for a case that conforms to the phone design. It also doesn't have a Qwerty keyboard input for texting. A couple small sacrifices for a smart phone without a contract, a steep price or a monthly gouging.Very happy with this phone.",59

I was left to research online to navigate. That is not my only issue I have noticed that its not picking up the local frequency/network that I use in my country it is always saying ""Emergency call Only"" or ""no signal"".

The other one has the SOD ' Sleep of Death' issue multiple times. SOD = phone shuts itself off. Google solutions and tried them all but nothing works. Downloaded the lastest OS - Gingerbread 2.3.4 thru Samsung Kies but issue remains. This one is going back for an exchange. Neither of the phone is rooted.Overall I really like the phone, value vs. price and I think you are not going to get a better deal. A good beginner android phone that is almost iphone like.Pros: Screen size 3.5"" is perfect for me. The overall phone size isn't too big either. Plenty of free apps to download. Gingerbread improves the battery life.Cons: Internal memory is small. You won't be able to download a lot of apps. And you can't install the apps to the external SD card unless you root the phone (become a superuser) but that immediately voids the warranty. I read somewhere that you can un-root the phone if needed... Last minor issue, the touch screen isn't as sensitive as I like it but this could be the problem with having a Zagg shield on.Update 9/9/11: Received the replacement but it is also going back to Amazon. This time I didn't even power up the phone, the problem is on the touchscreen, there are 6 spots (about the size of a dime) that cannot be cleaned, looks like it is actually on the other side of screen.

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,2,"The phone seemed nice at first and I was happy that being a gsm phone I was able to connect to the internet successfully with a sim card from a different company. However, the internet is not 3g, nor even fast enough to make it usable. I can't even send or download photos successfully unless I continue to keep the screen lit and still it will take twenty minutes. I use a straighttalk sim, so maybe with other companies it could be faster. I also connected it to wifi which is only slightly faster when it decides to work. The phone is durable, I dropped it in a puddle and have thrown it in anger and it still works fine as I expected. Only the good die young. Also, while texting (even before the puddle and the tantrum) it will not read what buttons I am hitting. The screen works but the keyboard is unresponsive. This happens frequently and closing the app and locking and unlocking the phone doesn't help every time. The phone memory itself sucks, and there's only certain things you can put on the memory card. It should only be sold for fifty bucks tops, it's so buggy. The only reason I kept it is because I needed a phone and didn't want the hassle. Upsides; camera quality is nice and there is a flash. Cases for them are highly protective and waterproof and cheap if you look on amazon.",1

I was charged $75.00 and I gladly paid it because it was very important to have a working telephone in a foreign country. I contacted Blutekusa, the seller, and their response was that they had never heard of someone being charged $75.00 to unlock a cell phone. I sent Blutekusa a copy of the invoice. They were not willing to make me whole even though it was their fault I found myself without a working cell phone in a foreign country, the sole reason I bought the cell phone in the first place. I can understand that a mistake was made, we, as humans are not perfect, but they know they made a mistake and they are not willing to accept responsibility.

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,5,"I purchased this phone for a couple of months and to be honest is my first experience with smartphones, because it has taken me several days to get familiar with its operation, and I went from having a regular phone to this incredibly functional gadget and change has been a noticeable leap, its 800 mHz processor is quite fast and efficient. The touch screen is very good quality, sensible, scratch resistent (gorilla glass), decent amazing definition and brightness. It's camera takes pictures of acceptable quality, and the video runs smoothly. The size of the phone without being small makes it suitable for carrying in your pocket without a problem, or the discomfort of smartphones largest and highest range and price.Android as operattivo system is very friendly and intuitive, easy to use and I love power because all you can do with a phone and more!Works great with the 3G network from my country (Costa Rica). Simply insert the SIM and voila, a few minutes I was conected and running properly, I did not think it would be so simple to be honest!The only negative thing I could say so far is the short battery life when using multiple functions simultaneously (common problem with smartphones) as already mentioned in other grades here ... But this is easily solved with an extra charger in the office and at home, and upload daily ... jeje!At last I can recommend this phone without fear for those who like me (not being a fan for the latest in technology) nedd the benefits of a smartphone that have a good average performance, but with several extra applications that allow you to grow and evolve according to your needs as a user ... By the way I wrote this review from my phone, which I think is really amazing!Adquir√≠ este telefono desde hace un par de meses y para ser sincero es mi primer experiencia con smartphones, debido a esto me ha tomado varios dias para familiarizarme con su funcionamiento, ya que pas√© de tener un telefono regular a este increiblemente funcional aparatito y el cambio ha sido un salto cualitativo notorio, su procesador de 800 mhz es bastante rapido y eficiente. La pantalla tactil es de muy buena calidad, sensible, resistente a rayones (gorilla glass), con decente definicion y brillos asombrosos. Su camara toma fotos de una calidad aceptable, y el video corre muy bien. El tama√±o del telefono sin ser peque√±o, lo hace adecuado para llevarlo en el bolsillo sin mayor problema, ni la incomodidad de smartphones mas grandes y de mayor rango y precio.Android como sistema operattivo es muy amigable e intuitivo, facil de usar y me encanta ya que potencia todo lo que puedes hacer con un telefono y mas!Funciona muy bien con la red 3G de mi pais (Costa Rica). Simplemente insertar el SIM y listo, a los pocos minutos ya estaba enlazado y funcionando adecudamente, no crei que seria tan sencillo para ser honestos!La unica cosa negativa que podria decir hasta ahora es la corta duracion de la bateria al usar varias funciones simultaneamente (problema comun con los smartphones) como ya lo han mencionado en otras calificaciones aqui... Pero esto es facilmente solucionable con un cargador extra en la oficina y otro en casa, y cargarlo diariamente... jeje!En fin puedo recomendar sin temores a este telefono para aquellos que como yo (sin ser un fanatico por lo ultimo en tecnolgia) ocupamos los beneficios de un buen smartphone de desempe√±o medio, pero con varias aplicaciones extra que te permitan crecer segun tus necesidades y evolucionar como usuario... Por cierto he escrito esta critica desde mi telefono; lo cual me parece asombroso!!!",197

The touch screen is very good, sensible, scratch resistent (gorilla glass), and awesome definition and brightness, the camera takes awesome pictures and I belive the quality of the video it's pretty good too. The size of the phone it's great, very lightweight and very suitable for carrying in your pocket or any purse without a problem, its a little smaller than most smartphones of the same range and price which is a great feature. This phone works great with the 3G network and existing SIM card.I would certainly recommend this phone without hesitation to anyone whether is your first smartphone or you're a savvy of the latest technology.",0

When it said SIM CARD CRASH for my AT&T SIM that works perfectly over another phone, I tried not to blame the phone and went ahead to get a T-mobile prepaid. I discover that the internet speed is exeedingly slow (2G instead of 3G). I again take it as a service provider issue and don't blame the phone. I buy a T-mobile prepaid (at least the card gets read though the internet speed is lousy at best). The next morning I see that my previously full charged battery has run down completely (with virtually NO usage in 8 hours or so). I charge for some 45 minutes and take the phone to work. The next I take out my phone is at noontime and guess what- the battery is dead.This phone is a joke. $184 for this is an even bigger joke. Please stay away. I am returning this product ASAP.

It looks very good, ie looks like all the newer smart phones and nobody can tell the difference between the Ace and other much more expensive phones. It works well, with some minor hiccups occasionally (it has turned off unexpectedly 2-4 times since I've had it). I have enjoyed having it as it meets all my needs. My biggest complaint is its very limited internal memory. You can't save apps on the Micro SD card (I bought a 16GB SanDisk); apps must be saved in the internal memory and therefore not all apps I want can fit, and I've always had to delete other apps to make room for new ones.

It would almost be perfect for me if it had more internal memory and I think I would appreciate a tiny bit more screen size. I have a 32 GB card in there, but it needs internal memory to hold many apps. I do not believe myself to be a very big app person, but you have to be an incredibly basic app person to find this to be adequate. I have dropped this phone countless times. I may even have dropped it off a roof (I'm a roofer). No need for a screen protector. I've never really used the case and I know I've dropped it face down in rocks before. In 2 years of abuse I think I have one tiny scratch on the screen that I barely notice. I want to get a Moto G now...I hope it isn't too bulky and huge! I used this phone with Att and used the unlimited data with tethering (att didn't know). I then used this phone on a prepaid Gophone plan and tethered their unlimited data for a basic phone for a month and a half before they saw the countless GB I used and shut off the data. Now I use it with an actual smartphone plan on Gophone. I took it to Nigeria and popped in the MTN sim card and it worked perfectly fine.

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,4,"I bought this phone for my wife at the same time I bought the Galaxy Note 1. I decided on this one because although she doesn't need a lot of bells & whistles I wanted her to have a functional smartphone that didn't cost an arm & a leg. This phone has everything she wanted + a little more. At first there was an issue w/ the phone shutting off after 'waking up' from stand-by mode but I looked into the problem online & found A-LOT of complaints about this very problem. The solution came from an Android forum that said the problem lies w/ when the phone went into sleep mode the WiFi goes off then restarts on wake. I read that if we go into the WiFi menu> advanced settings> WiFi sleep> and select ""Never"" that this should solve the issue. Well it did, I think it shut off maybe once or twice more after selecting ""Never"" in the menu but has completely stopped jamming u[p/shutting off for the month since I'd changed the setting. All in all, a cool little phone w/ a very nice looking and moderately sized screen that looks and acts like a much more expensive full touchscreen smartphone.",2

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,3,"The product was shipped on time and in perfect condition. The look and feel is the same as other Andriod phones. The phone is slightly slower then the duo core new Andriods but that's expected as the Galaxy Ace only has one CPU. I bought this phone so that I can have an Andriod to use when I travel out of the US.The first problem I face was it comes with the language preset to Spanish. The manual that comes in the box is also Spanish so that didn't help. Luckily, after some guessing at the setting options I finally found the language setting and selected English. First problem solved. Actually an easier way is to have a friend who has an English Andriod so you can follow his setting tree and find the language setting without guessing.Then I have to download the English manual. The Samsung US site does not even recognize the S5830M model number. I had to go to the Samsung UK site with this url to download the English mauual:[...]. Second problem solved.I set up the phone according to the manual and registered with AT&T. But then I found I cannot get to the Internet when I'm not on wi-fi. That is not good as I cannot use the free GPS without Internet. I brought the phone to an experienced tech who specilizes in connecting unlocked phones and finally I'm enjoying the whole phone.I would have given it 4 stars if the phone comes set in English and duo languange manuals which is usuall for phones sold in the US. The problem with AT&T is AT&T's and does not count in here. I would have given it 5 stars if it is faster, but at the Amazon price I'm not complaining.Good luck connecting your phone to other carriers, Perhaps they may be less restrictive with their connection.",3

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,5,I have been unhappy with my phone for a while. My brother-in-law told me to buy an unlocked phone and hop on his family plan with him and we would just split the bill. Great phone for the price.

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,2,"From the start, it exhibited a number of big problems. First off, the wi-fi driver would screw up and wouldn't turn on, no matter how I turned it on. In Wi-fi settings it would simply read ""error."" There is a phone number you can type in to restart the driver and fix it, but it was happening so often that it was unacceptable.Second, calls. Even with full signal and all, for some reason, the phone simply wouldn't make calls. You would dial a number, and it would hang up before the call even began. I tried everything and to no avail.Third: the phone kept shutting itself off. Randomly, the screen would go black and I would have to turn it on again. It was aggravating and made the phone rather unusable.Overall I think that if these bugs were fixed, it would be a fine entry-to-mid-level Android phone. It looks nice, sounds nice, has all the bells and whistles- but until they work properly, then it is all moot. Returning.",4

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,4,"I just bought a third because I had two other ones stolen. I was thinking of trying another phone but decided I'd go with what I know and like.I actually love the phone. I used a Galaxy S for a while and thought it too big. This is the iPhone copy that has more screen space, less weight and softer feel.People talk of battery life but if you don't have constant updates of all your things (Facebook, email, etc.), I have had my battery last 4 days with not much use (some txting, calls and emails), 2 days with heavy use. I use my phone to call and txt, WhatsApp txt, and check Gmail; I'm not a Facebook maniac, play games (except chess), and have to be constantly checking it; nor do I browse that often on it. I use it to calculate things, unit conversions, read newspapers, translate languages.But you have to take care of your (any) battery: over charge the first charge, you don't let the battery die completely (turn off before that), and after it gets to 100% charge, you disconnect the charger. Anything else you'll kill how long the battery will last.Never thought that I would worry that much, but the camera is great for just 5MP, taking great, vibrantly colored photos. The flash is very strong and works great with a Flashlight App. I love the panoramic shots.You do have to buy the correct version for your country to get the 3G features. The phone will work, just not the 3G aspect. I'm in South America so this one works for me.All told I'm happy I didn't move to another phone and stuck with the Ace.",6

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,4,"I ordered this phone after reading reviews and determining that I didn't want to spend so much money for a cell phone as what you normally end up paying through a cell phone company. I've always had good luck with returns on purchases through Amazon so I was fairly certain that if I needed to return it, I could.I was pleasantly surprised when I received the phone. It was well packaged, shipped quick and even charged. There were no instructions with it but that's easy enough to find online, which I did. The phone is very nice and I can make the font large enough to read, which can be a problem. The screen is large enough so you can see what you're doing and I love the GPS! I was able to navigate through the settings easily and had the phone set up in no time.All in all, it was a very good purchase for my first smart phone and I didn't have to take out a loan to afford it! :-) :-) :-)",3

Will pick up local SIM card in Nicaragua for when I am away from wifi. I will update this review as I progress.Oh, added 16 GB flash card.

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,1,"I purchased the product to have an unlocked phone when traveling abroad, which I do many times a year. The phone worked for less than two month before, for no reason (never dropped, submerged, etc, the phone), the phone stopped turning on due to hardware issues. When I called Samsung, they told me that unlocked phones are NOT eligible for warranty. This policy is Samsung-specific (Apple, for instance, honors warranties regardless of sales channel). I have had other smart phones (Blackberry, iPhone, HTC, etc) for many years and have never seen a phone malfunction so quickly. CAVEAT EMPTOR - SAMSUNG PHONES HAVE MAJOR QUALITY CONTROL ISSUES. BUYING AN UNLOCKED PHONE ONLINE VOIDS THE ONE-YEAR WARRANTY.In terms of the phone itself, it runs extremely slowly. I'm not sure if it's the service provider or phone itself. I've used the phone in France on the Sfr Network, USA on the AT&T Network, in England on the Vodaphone Network, and in Spain on the Orange Network (all pre-paid service) in the <2 months that the phone worked. Of these places it worked best in the UK but data speed was still significantly slower than my iPhone on AT&T in New York. The screen resolution is so poor, you won't be able to read anything on the 3.5"" screen without enlarging the text. The phone itself feels plasticky/chincy. I would consider HTC for higher end Android phones. For lower end phones, there are better options from Motorola or others. Avoid Samsung phones at all costs from a 1) customer service, 2) quality perspective, and 3) functionality perspective (at least lower end smart phones).",3

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,5,"I live in a very rural area with very limited signal. It has been a nightmare because we need to be able to communicate on the far flung areas we farm. I did enough research to find out maybe a Quad phone would be the answer.It IS!!I have four bars!!This phone can go loud if you need it to. I have problems hearing my phone because it is in my purse. I can't normally get signal at home, so I only use it in town. Now I can use it to call for help when I'm stuck.This phone is easy to use and has tutorials to help understand features.If you've got a bit of hearing loss, this one is clear as a bell.I can talk to it to dial the phone.I can talk to it to get directions like a GPS unit.I can talk to it to send a message, take a note, or well, I don't know everything yet. I've been neglecting other things to play with it all morning. The MOST awesome phone for an idiot to use. That would be me!Be patient with yourself if you get one of these.

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,3,"I bought two of these after trying two Motorolas that I returned. These Samsungs have performed well. They accepted my sim card with no problem. I was looking mostly at price. Problem is that there is practically no internal memory. I put a 32 gig card in one and a 16 in the other. That doesn't help. There is no internal space to download apps and you can't get rid of the preloaded ones. You cannot move apps from internal memory over to the sd card. Also, default settings are metric. They can be changed to US. Still some of the spellings are British/Australian English. But, if you can work around these issues, the phones are fine. If you are planning on adding a lot of apps, do your homework. These phones will probably not be for you.",0
Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,4,"This is definitely a strong phone, however if you plan to use apps frequently, or play games, you will need a different phone. The storage is barely sufficient for the stock apps. Adding memory will help for storing music and such but you'll still need more app space if you want to use even the basic social media and productivity apps. It is a smooth running phone otherwise - I have it since November 2012 and it's in great condition. I have it in a basic plastic case with a screen protector. I dropped it many times, my baby teethes on it, and it's still running strong.Pros:strong phoneexpandable memory for music, photosdecent camerauniversal connectivity (micro usb charger/port and 3.5mm headphone jack)easy to find accessories, cases, skins, coversnice size but not too big (about the size of an iphone 4)comes with two outside covers - a white glossy and black textured for style choices. Although you never see it on mine - it's covered.unlocked gsm phone for traveling abroad and for use on some US networks (at&t, t-mobile and other sim card companies)Cons:very little app memoryolder version of android, is not compatible with some apps which you will anyway not have enough memory for.In summary: get it if you want an economical internet-connected device with a few apps, wifi, gps, bluetooth, etc. that you can use abroad or at home. Do not get if you want games, and many apps.",0

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,5,"I never had a smartphone but decided to dump Verizon and switch to Simple Mobile and try this one. I wasn't sure it would work well with SM after some of the reviews, since it is older and not really for use in the US, but it works just fine. And althought Samsung doesn't support the phone in the US, Amazon supplies a 1-yr warranty free. Can't beat that deal. I've enjoyed the internet capability, GPS, texting, apps, all do just fine. I got a longer lasting battery for $10 and it lasts 2 full days without turning it off. The phone syncs with my computer using Samsung KIES software, also a big plus to manage contact lists, podcasts, and music. At a cost of 1/2 Verizon's monthly costs for phone, text, and internet, I am VERY happy phone and Simple Mobile.So, if you want to get into the new millenium, dump Verizon, get this smartphone, and save money with Simple Mobile.",4

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,1,"I bought this phone 25 five days ago. It looked a good phone at the beginning, everything worked as expected. The only drawback at the time was the battery life. You have to be charging the phone every single day. Then suddenly the phone started to make a weird thing. It detected like if I were plugging in the charger cable showing the battery icon in the top right as if the phone were charging then 3 seconds later the phone said the cable was disconnected. Weird! At the first day of this weird behavior the phone did it like two times at the day. But then next day it went crazy, it had the same behavior but now the phone displayed it was plugged to the charger and then 1 second later it was not and it did it until I turn it off. I tried by removing the battery and give it the phone a rest like 15 minutes, then I put the battery back and turned it on again. It looked like the issue went away but one hour later guess what. It started again. So GOOD BYE, nice to meet you worst phone ever. I am returning it to Amazon. Although it was fulfilled by amazon the phone was sold by a third party, so check that first.",25
Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,4,"The Samsung Galaxy Ace is a real pleasure to use. It is relatively small and light making it easy to carry. The display is very readable even outside in the sun. Call reception is very good and voice clarity at either end is very good as well. Auto rotation lags a bit and sometimes needs a little prodding. Battery life is great. The camera is good with resolution and clarity more than acceptable. Picture colors can be a little washed out as the auto white balance sometimes has trouble. I've taken to Ace to Germany and Austria and had not trouble connecting overseas cellular services. Very seamless. To date I have not been able to wirelessly connect to my home network and download/upload files. I must connect via USB and use the Kies software which is really clunky. But I'm still learning.

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,1,"I bought this phone after reading good reviews on it. And while the phone itself preforms okay, I say okay because the in phone storage is inadequate and even with a SD card I can't down load many apps to my phone because the internal phone storage wont allow it. Someone said the battery life is good but I think it is poor, mine doesn't stay charged for more than a couple hours if me or my kids are playing games on it. I have since learned the reason that the storage is so low and the battery life is so poor is that it comes with many useless apps that you can not remove and that stay running in the background so they drain your battery power.I'm actually surprised this phone is even allowed on the market or has not been recalled, the power cord that comes with it is extremely dangerous. It is cheaply made and because it has to be converted from the European standard it has two different prongs hooked together. They don't stay together very well and are very cheaply made. It comes with two and both broke very quickly, my five year old got a very bad shock and there sparks and smoke appeared when she tried to unplug it one day. Half of it just stayed stuck in the outlet while the other half came out leaving bare metal sticking out to shock anyone who didn't know better like my daughter. I turned of the power and got it out. Luckily you can buy power cords at most stores as it is a common one, so if you do get this phone be sure to throw away the cords that come with it and go buy new ones that are made for US outlets.But the biggest problem is this. If something happens to your phone. And I just dropped mine and called Samsung support they will not help you. This phone is made in China and the US based Samsung is not affiliated with them. So they would not even answer any simple questions. So basically I have had my phone for 3 months and need it fixed probably a simple fix and there is nothing I can do about it. They did give me a number to the support in China but it is a international call like that is any help at all. Thanks a lot Samsung!!! Don't buy this phone, everyone I know that has a cell phone has something happen to it and needs help sometime. If you buy this phone you are on your own. Next time I am going to buy something local from Walmart or Bestbuy so that I know I can get US support.",2

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,4,"I received my Samsung Galaxy Ace and charged it for a while. After that, I started using it and made a few phone calls. Good phone quality. It was much easier to hear on this phone than with the HTC Nexus One I previously owned that died on me a week before I purchased this. 3G appears to work well here in southern California, and it's on T-Mobile.I did notice the phone was set up for Canadian English, and was even set up with a Koodo Mobile splash screen (Canadian mobile company). That doesn't bother me so much as far as the splash screen goes. The Canadian English wasn't a problem until I installed the Amazon MP3 Player (because I purchase MP3s from Amazon, normally). Apparently Amazon MP3 will not work with the Canadian English locale. The phone doesn't come with the US English locale, but if you go into Google Play and type in ""more locales"" you will find a number of apps that will add more locales to your phone. I was able to use this and Amazon MP3 Player started working.Messaging is easier with the Swype keyboard already included with the phone.I tested out Angry Birds on the phone, then removed it. The responsiveness was pretty good. I only removed Angry Birds because I prefer to play it on my larger tablet.Space is pretty limited on the storage, so I was happy to see the seller, BlueTekUSA, included a 4 gigabyte MicroSD card, and I can move some apps to my SD Card. (I'll be able to move just about any app to it once I root the phone and use Link2SD).As I said, I mainly bought this to replace my Nexus One that had died but I also use my phone for testing websites and HTML5 mobile apps I make. I do most of my work from home or from Starbucks, and sometimes the internet goes out on the Starbucks or home connection, and I will sometimes use tethering and use my phone as a backup internet connection and continue with my work and stay connected to everyone at the office.I've not experienced any of the lag issues or 3G issues others seem to have experienced.

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,4,"I bought this phone for my teenage son who wanted a smartphone. I chose the quad band so he could take it overseas and use it there too. Since I wanted to use it with a T-Mobile pre-paid sim card, I needed to find a sim-lock free phone. The Samsung Galaxy Ace seemed perfect and it's features appealed to my son. Unfortunately, as we found out after only a few months, this phone has not good reception with the T-Mobile sim card. Most of the time it has no reception at all except for the 911 call. It might be a good phone with other providers but not with T-Mobile. The other features of the phone were fine. The camera was pretty decent too. The touch screen was not terribly responsive though.Edited review on 5/8/2015:after having this phone sit around for 18 months, I decided to find out why it would not work with my carrier (T-Mobile) despite being advertised as a GSM phone. I went to several cell phone repair shops which, of course, quoted outrageous prices for ""fixing"" it. One shop thought the contacts of the SIM card slot were bad; another blamed it on being an international (Canadian) model. The technician at Batteries and Bulbs even opened it up, free of charge, to look at the SIM card slot. He said that everything was in fine order. He indicated that it might have something to do with the phone's carrier settings. And that's what it was. It took me an afternoon of looking around but I finally figured it out. The setting had been on ""select automatically"" (either GSM or CDMA) when it should have been set to ""GSM"". After I made that change, no more problems! The phone works perfectly and has good cell reception all the time.",1

The processor is very good and support any kind of work (even using antivirus). The only thing that could be better is the battery, it lasts 2 days (using a lot of wi-fi, though not using 3G or 2G), but I think this is a normal issue for smartphones with big screens and wi-fi access.",1
Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,2,"I ordered this phone on Saturday March 7, 2012 and was pretty excited as this was to be my first smart phone. I know that's funny even to me. I added next day delivery and got it on Monday as projected, so everything up until this point had been satisfactory. Opening the package, I found everything to be as it should be at first glance. However, when anyone drops this kind of money, they are going to do a thorough review of the product no matter what it is. Upon closer inspection of the box, I noticed that the language on the back of the box was in spanish but that is not what really stood out. What really stood out is the fact that it said the model number whas not an S5830L as ordered but instead it was an S5830M. I had researched this phone before purchase and was not familair with an M model. I though maybe it's just the box...Lol. Not a chance. I took the phone out of the box and took the back plate off to check the Samsung manufaturer sticker for the model and sure enough it was in fact a S5830M model. I thought, what could be the difference. I tossed in the battery and started it up. The native language on the phone was Spanish...LolOk, now I was concerned. Was this a knockoff or what? So I next called Samsung and gave them the S/N off of the sticker on the inside. The customer service rep told me that it came up as "" No Information Available"". The rep then told me that that was because it was not a model that they supported in the U.S. I asked, ok so what does that mean? The rep told me that this phone was not meant for sale in the U.S. and that there would be absolutely no support for it here! No warranty, nothing. Now let me say this. I switched the language setting in the phone over to English and tested the phone out. Everything seems to work as it should. It also has the latest platform for gingerbread 2.3.6 . The ICS platform (also called the Icecream Sandwich platform is not available at this time for the Galaxy Ace). So everything seemed to check out with the exception that if anything ever happens to this phone then I am just screwed...LolNext I called Amazon and gave them the information about the phone and what I was told by the phon's manufacturer Samsung. Amazon appologized up and down and extended a 20% refund as well as offered to replace it with a full refund within 30 days should something not work. They (Amazon) also told me that they were going to investigate the seller as well as the rest of the stock that they have on hand for this phone. I want to be clear that Amazon has been very helpfull in this matter in standing behind their site and customers. Today, I called the 3rd party seller that is selling this phone. They are out of New York. I talked to the manager and he said that the SKU numbers matched up with their product and that it had to be Amazon's fault. He went on to say that he would send me the correct phone if I would call Amazon and return the discount that Amazon gave me first. Now come on people, I didn't just get off the boat. I did tell him that I would be happy to give the discount back but I would have to have what I ordered first. No Way would I give it back first and then still be stuck with a phone that had no warranty and would not have any assistance for should something go south with it. He agreed and said that he would send me an email with the tracking number within the hour. Lo and behold, that hour came and went with no email.It just shows me that I was correct in my assumtion. In short, be careful and order from this merchant at your own risk. You are deffinately rolling the dice.Amazon still **ROCKS** though!",92

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,5,"I call this my 'travel phone' and use AT&T pay as you go plan here at home in USA. Easy SIM activation by phone and $25 every 3 months keeps phone number current. I don't make many call and text occasionally. Gmail is free so I mostly use that. This is also used as a back up phone because I still have my expensive VZ plan with locked phone still under contract and it's not GSM. On recent Costa Rica vacation this phone was perfect! Few dollars to get a Kolbi ICE SIM card near the Liberia airport and after activation I put $25 USD on it. I called the USA each day, text and local Costa Rica calls daily, Had GPS/navigation while my husband drove our rental car all over, data when I was away from free wifi, looked stuff up on Internet and sent emails while husband drove, took photos and videos and quickly uploaded to Facebook, and after ten days vacation - I didn't even use all the $25! Easy to check balance and add money if necessary. In the USA, I popped my AT&T SIM card back in once we landed at airport. I was able to text and make calls again. My only complaint with this amazing phone is that the internal memory is too small. Have to be stingy with apps and move any I can to the SD card (supports up to 32 GB). When my other phone's contract is up, I am thinking about using just this one. I have the S5830 ""M"" and not had a problem. When I go to Europe, this baby is going with me!",0

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,2,"Ok. here goes. I really wanted to like my new phone. Since I got this phone I noticed a few quirks about it but thought maybe it was just a one off thing.however these quirky things progressed to annoyance. The phone is slow to respond to commands. I do not have too many downloads on it as I thought those might slow it down. I have a memory card that came with the phone and for some reason the phone goes blank when i use the usb cord to upload pictures. sometimes while trying to initiate a function, the screen goes blank/black. dialing is another problem. in the middle of dialing the screen jumps to the home screen or it just sticks on one number and the others become unresponsive. Another problem is it gets super super hot. even when not in use. My daughter told me maybe my battery is swollen so I purchased a new one. SAME PROBLEM Also the battery life is very low. during the course of the day with no special activities taking place on the phone by about four p.m the battery is dead. With the new one, it has improved a bit but still have to charge it nightly. Note I do not have internet to this phone so the only usage is to send and receive calls and texts. no music etc. nada! Basic usage. so after four months. Not impressed.Another thing I forgot to add is that it keeps saying internal phone memory almost full when I have next to nothing saved on the phone!!! Like I said before, I use it as a BASIC phone. I deleted all incoming/outgoing calls and messages, cleared the cache of the few (facebook and gmail) apps i have and still it says internal memory almost full and messages are not being received. stresssss!",1

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,1,"I purchased this phone for my grandson who lives in Norway. Just before the warranty expired it stopped working. I am writing this to inform international buyers that Samsung does not repair it in the U.S. It is my understanding international phones must be sent to the country where it was purchased to get repaired. But not this phone. When I received the phone from my grandson, I called Samsung to find out where to send it to get it repaired and was told it must be sent to the U.K. where it was made and where repair takes place. I never expected this to happen. I expected Samsung to repair it in the U.S. I spent many hours trying to find out where their repair facility is located. Customer Service is poor. They did not offer to help resolve the confusion, lack of information which caused an unnecessary shipment of the phone from Norway to the U.S. which by the time I received it, it was too late to have it repaired under warranty. I believe now that this is known, Amazon.com should inform their customers so they can make a decision as to whether to buy this phone or look at other phones that are repaired in the U.S. It taught me ""Buyer Beware"" and to ask questions before buying items that are not repaired in the U.S.",3

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,3,"I recently bought 2 of the Galaxy Ace as gifts for family members who were just starting out with smartphones. This phone covers the basics, you can send and receive calls along with messages, most applications I checked are compatible with the phone, camera is ok but not great. I am a self proclaimed phone junkie so I would never have this phone for my personal use but if I was starting out, this would be the phone to get. The biggest limitations keeping this phone from being great are the following: Single core, overall speed of the phone is 800 MHZ, internal memory is 0.158 GB. However, the phone will recognize up to 32GB's of storage but you will probably need to root your phone in order to move apps to SD card. The other disappointment which does not impact the performance of the phone was the size of the phone. I don't know if it was small or if I am just used to big phones.

However, Seller sent me the same e-mail that I need to contact tech. support. After seller didn't give me any help, I filed a claim to Amazon. With the help from Amazon, Seller confirmed me a full refund.",0

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,2,"The phone seemed nice at first and I was happy that being a gsm phone I was able to connect to the internet successfully with a sim card from a different company. However, the internet is not 3g, nor even fast enough to make it usable. I can't even send or download photos successfully unless I continue to keep the screen lit and still it will take twenty minutes. I use a straighttalk sim, so maybe with other companies it could be faster. I also connected it to wifi which is only slightly faster when it decides to work. The phone is durable, I dropped it in a puddle and have thrown it in anger and it still works fine as I expected. Only the good die young. Also, while texting (even before the puddle and the tantrum) it will not read what buttons I am hitting. The screen works but the keyboard is unresponsive. This happens frequently and closing the app and locking and unlocking the phone doesn't help every time. The phone memory itself sucks, and there's only certain things you can put on the memory card. It should only be sold for fifty bucks tops, it's so buggy. The only reason I kept it is because I needed a phone and didn't want the hassle. Upsides; camera quality is nice and there is a flash. Cases for them are highly protective and waterproof and cheap if you look on amazon.",

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,3,"I purchased this phone in Jan 2012 and have been satisfied with this phone ever since. It looks very good, ie looks like all the newer smart phones and nobody can tell the difference between the Ace and other much more expensive phones. It works well, with some minor hiccups occasionally (it has turned off unexpectedly 2-4 times since I've had it). I have enjoyed having it as it meets all my needs. My biggest complaint is its very limited internal memory. You can't save apps on the Micro SD card (I bought a 16GB SanDisk); apps must be saved in the internal memory and therefore not all apps I want can fit, and I've always had to delete other apps to make room for new ones.

The telephone was orden international for the United States. Sometimes when you must attend a phone call o after hanging out the call, the screen becomes black and there is no way to push a botton.

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,4,"I love this little phone. It would almost be perfect for me if it had more internal memory and I think I would appreciate a tiny bit more screen size. I have a 32 GB card in there, but it needs internal memory to hold many apps. I do not believe myself to be a very big app person, but you have to be an incredibly basic app person to find this to be adequate. I have dropped this phone countless times. I may even have dropped it off a roof (I'm a roofer). No need for a screen protector. I've never really used the case and I know I've dropped it face down in rocks before. In 2 years of abuse I think I have one tiny scratch on the screen that I barely notice. I want to get a Moto G now...I hope it isn't too bulky and huge! I used this phone with Att and used the unlimited data with tethering (att didn't know). I then used this phone on a prepaid Gophone plan and tethered their unlimited data for a basic phone for a month and a half before they saw the countless GB I used and shut off the data. Now I use it with an actual smartphone plan on Gophone. I took it to Nigeria and popped in the MTN sim card and it worked perfectly fine. I only wish I could make this screen a tiny bit bigger and upgrade the internal memory.",0

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,5,"I purchased this phone for a couple of months and to be honest is my first experience with smartphones, because it has taken me several days to get familiar with its operation, and I went from having a regular phone to this incredibly functional gadget and change has been a noticeable leap, its 800 mHz processor is quite fast and efficient. The touch screen is very good quality, sensible, scratch resistent (gorilla glass), decent amazing definition and brightness. It's camera takes pictures of acceptable quality, and the video runs smoothly. The size of the phone without being small makes it suitable for carrying in your pocket without a problem, or the discomfort of smartphones largest and highest range and price.Android as operattivo system is very friendly and intuitive, easy to use and I love power because all you can do with a phone and more!Works great with the 3G network from my country (Costa Rica). Simply insert the SIM and voila, a few minutes I was conected and running properly, I did not think it would be so simple to be honest!The only negative thing I could say so far is the short battery life when using multiple functions simultaneously (common problem with smartphones) as already mentioned in other grades here ... But this is easily solved with an extra charger in the office and at home, and upload daily ... jeje!At last I can recommend this phone without fear for those who like me (not being a fan for the latest in technology) nedd the benefits of a smartphone that have a good average performance, but with several extra applications that allow you to grow and evolve according to your needs as a user ... By the way I wrote this review from my phone, which I think is really amazing!Adquir√≠ este telefono desde hace un par de meses y para ser sincero es mi primer experiencia con smartphones, debido a esto me ha tomado varios dias para familiarizarme con su funcionamiento, ya que pas√© de tener un telefono regular a este increiblemente funcional aparatito y el cambio ha sido un salto cualitativo notorio, su procesador de 800 mhz es bastante rapido y eficiente. La pantalla tactil es de muy buena calidad, sensible, resistente a rayones (gorilla glass), con decente definicion y brillos asombrosos. Su camara toma fotos de una calidad aceptable, y el video corre muy bien. El tama√±o del telefono sin ser peque√±o, lo hace adecuado para llevarlo en el bolsillo sin mayor problema, ni la incomodidad de smartphones mas grandes y de mayor rango y precio.Android como sistema operattivo es muy amigable e intuitivo, facil de usar y me encanta ya que potencia todo lo que puedes hacer con un telefono y mas!Funciona muy bien con la red 3G de mi pais (Costa Rica). Simplemente insertar el SIM y listo, a los pocos minutos ya estaba enlazado y funcionando adecudamente, no crei que seria tan sencillo para ser honestos!La unica cosa negativa que podria decir hasta ahora es la corta duracion de la bateria al usar varias funciones simultaneamente (problema comun con los smartphones) como ya lo han mencionado en otras calificaciones aqui... Pero esto es facilmente solucionable con un cargador extra en la oficina y otro en casa, y cargarlo diariamente... jeje!En fin puedo recomendar sin temores a este telefono para aquellos que como yo (sin ser un fanatico por lo ultimo en tecnolgia) ocupamos los beneficios de un buen smartphone de desempe√±o medio, pero con varias aplicaciones extra que te permitan crecer segun tus necesidades y evolucionar como usuario... Por cierto he escrito esta critica desde mi telefono; lo cual me parece asombroso!!!",197

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,2,"I bought 3 Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace phones on Amazon. Two worked OK but the third one was an absolute dud. The charger worked just fine but the phone just will not charge. I suspect the battery is dead but I am not sure. After all, the battery on a new phone should not be problematic. By the time the phone was returned to me, the return window was expired so I now have to replace the phone and I am left with a phone that does not work.",0
Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,3,"Similar size to iPhone. But with android os. Android is great but this phone in particular is slow with web, the camera isn't great, the picture quality is very low compared to most touchscreen phones of today. Felt like I was using a phone from 3 years ago. This phone is sufficient for people who want a basic android phone for some apps, not too much web use, and not much camera use. Not for me because to pay so much for data plan, I want my phone to be everything and more. So I returned it and put a few extra hundred into a better phone.",4
Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,5,Was bought as a present for a 18yr old cousin. So far she is happy cuz this is her first smartphone.,0
Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,5,"I have owned this phone for just about 4 weeks now.As for the design of the physical device, the size and shape is very similar to iphone so it feels comfortable and almost perfect when held in your hand. I have not owned an iphone before, but I have held them.I do wish the micro USB input was at the bottom of the phone, but the little door to keep dust out is definitely nice. Comparing this device to other smartphones I have owned, it seems that in most cases, the audio port is always next to the USB port and having the audio port at the top is a big plus for me.The screen is very nice and so far, the pictures have been good. The microphone is poor for video recording, but nobody has complained about the sound during a conversation. Besides talking through the handset, I also use a bluetooth headset, which I already owned, and though I have not had a phone conversaton with any other mic'd headsets yet, but I have listened to music through other headphones, as well as the the stock accessory, which sounds more than decent, and the volume output is adequate.The best software feature on this phone is Swype keyboard input system. It takes a bit to master Swype, but when combined with a small stylus, it is simply the fastest phone input method I have used yet. Not much else to say about the phone's software. It is Android and it can have a glitch every once in a while. I noticed a wierd moment last weekend when I was trying to turn on a flashlight app at the precise moment that my alarm was trying to alert. I did not know what was happening, but was able to I figure it out as soon as I restarted the phone.In my humble opinion, the price will probably go lower very soon, but I needed a phone and this compares very well with other unlocked, AT&T compatible, phones that I found available here on Amazon.",4

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,5,"This is a really good phone in today's mid range of Android phones.The phone is excellent and performs really well. It came with Gingerbread 2.3.4 already installed, that means, better performance compared to 2.2.x (Quadrant benchmarks this phone over the Samsung Galaxy S, which has a 1GHz CPU), better battery life and improves the video shooting quality to full VGA resolution.The phone battery stands for more than one full day with almost everything on (full brightness, GPS, Wifi, and BT), and lots of calls and sms per day, however,the 2G/3G data connection is off as I have Wifi connection in the office all day and I'm not using the mobile data connection in transit to/from home, where I also have wifi connection.Nevertheless, I tested the 3G connection with Movistar network in Venezuela and it works very well.The screen is bright and sharp. It does have some reduced visibility in direct sun light but it is way better than older touch screens I've used.The multi-touch works great. It is really sensible and the screen size is enough to type comfortable in landscape mode and almost comfortable in portrait mode.The only thing I haven't tried so far is the GPS and navigation functionality.The phone arrived without the 2GB microSD Card, but can't go against the phone and score it with 5 stars. In this regard, I have to blame the vendor: A to Z Wireless Solutions.",12

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,1,"I purchased this phone a week back and paid for a new phone. I recieved the phone today, in a box that looks worn out, with no instruction manual and no covering film on the phone which most new phones have. There was no warranty or any papers in the box. It seems like a refurbished or used phone, which explains the half price. But I didnt want a used phone and if this is used then amazon is misleading their customers. In the past I bought another cell phone from Amazon and it stopped working after 3 mths and I lost my money since I cant return after 30 days. I dont want that to happen again so I am planning on returning this phone too. I dont trust amazon with cellphones anymore! I will never order a cell phone from here ever again. Be careful when ordering this, I am planning on complaining to BBB but I have emiled ross cellular and am waiting a reponse fom them first. I will update later with their response.",
Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,5,"I purchased this phone for a couple of months and to be honest is my first experience with smartphones, because it has taken me several days to get familiar with its operation, and I went from having a regular phone to this incredibly functional gadget and change has been a noticeable leap, its 800 mHz processor is quite fast and efficient. The touch screen is very good quality, sensible, scratch resistent (gorilla glass), decent amazing definition and brightness. It's camera takes pictures of acceptable quality, and the video runs smoothly. The size of the phone without being small makes it suitable for carrying in your pocket without a problem, or the discomfort of smartphones largest and highest range and price.Android as operattivo system is very friendly and intuitive, easy to use and I love power because all you can do with a phone and more!Works great with the 3G network from my country (Costa Rica). Simply insert the SIM and voila, a few minutes I was conected and running properly, I did not think it would be so simple to be honest!The only negative thing I could say so far is the short battery life when using multiple functions simultaneously (common problem with smartphones) as already mentioned in other grades here ... But this is easily solved with an extra charger in the office and at home, and upload daily ... jeje!At last I can recommend this phone without fear for those who like me (not being a fan for the latest in technology) nedd the benefits of a smartphone that have a good average performance, but with several extra applications that allow you to grow and evolve according to your needs as a user ... By the way I wrote this review from my phone, which I think is really amazing!Adquir√≠ este telefono desde hace un par de meses y para ser sincero es mi primer experiencia con smartphones, debido a esto me ha tomado varios dias para familiarizarme con su funcionamiento, ya que pas√© de tener un telefono regular a este increiblemente funcional aparatito y el cambio ha sido un salto cualitativo notorio, su procesador de 800 mhz es bastante rapido y eficiente. La pantalla tactil es de muy buena calidad, sensible, resistente a rayones (gorilla glass), con decente definicion y brillos asombrosos. Su camara toma fotos de una calidad aceptable, y el video corre muy bien. El tama√±o del telefono sin ser peque√±o, lo hace adecuado para llevarlo en el bolsillo sin mayor problema, ni la incomodidad de smartphones mas grandes y de mayor rango y precio.Android como sistema operattivo es muy amigable e intuitivo, facil de usar y me encanta ya que potencia todo lo que puedes hacer con un telefono y mas!Funciona muy bien con la red 3G de mi pais (Venezuela). Simplemente insertar el SIM y listo, a los pocos minutos ya estaba enlazado y funcionando adecudamente, no crei que seria tan sencillo para ser honestos!La unica cosa negativa que podria decir hasta ahora es la corta duracion de la bateria al usar varias funciones simultaneamente (problema comun con los smartphones) como ya lo han mencionado en otras calificaciones aqui... Pero esto es facilmente solucionable con un cargador extra en la oficina y otro en casa, y cargarlo diariamente... jeje!En fin puedo recomendar sin temores a este telefono para aquellos que como yo (sin ser un fanatico por lo ultimo en tecnolgia) ocupamos los beneficios de un buen smartphone de desempe√±o medio, pero con varias aplicaciones extra que te permitan crecer segun tus necesidades y evolucionar como usuario... Por cierto he escrito esta critica desde mi telefono; lo cual me parece asombroso!!!",0
Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,1,"Very disappointed and cheated!Greetings, I'm from Venezuela. Recently bought two phones Galaxy ACE this seller, the shipping came at the right time, but to get the phones to my home I realized that one of them was broken, the place where the SIM card goes was broken! Nevertheless phones only have included Chinese and English language, when I decided to take the phone to specialized technicians Movistar Venezuela, I was informed that they could not change the language because I had phones that were sold of origin CHINA! because the operating system is not what normally bring Galaxy ACE and they could not do anything to change the operating system of the phone because the system is not allowed! and the saddest thing is that I have to stay with the phone because for me return shipping charge so much money!Amazon should do something about these types of sellers because they cause them to lose credibility! so fellow of Latin American and Spanish-speaking, if you are not good with English, because I do not recommend these devices and if you risk buying them like I did, then you can take the surprise you send the defective ones!!Muy decepcionado y estafado!!Saludos, soy de Venezuela. Recientemente compre dos celulares Galaxy ACE a este vendedor, el envio llego en el tiempo correcto, pero al llegar los celulares a mi casa me di cuenta que uno de ellos estaba roto, el sitio donde va la tarjeta SIM estaba roto!!! No obstante los telefonos solo tienen incluidos el idioma Chino e Ingles, cuando me decidi llevar los telefonos a los tecnicos especializados de Movistar Venezuela, se me informo que no podian cambiar el idioma pues los telefonos que me habian vendido eran de procedencia CHINA!!! pues el sistema operativo no es el que traen normalmente los Galaxy ACE y que no podian hacer nada para cambiar el sistema operativo de los telefonos ya que el sistema no se los permitia!! y lo mas triste es que me tengo que quedar con los telefonos porque para devolverlos me cobran mucho dinero de envio!!Amazon deberia hacer algo al respecto con estos tipos de vendedores pues ellos hacen que pierdan credibilidad!!! asi que companeros de latinoamerica y habla hispana, si no eres bueno con el ingles, pues no te recomiendo estos dispositivos y si te arriesgas a comprarlos como lo hice yo, pues te puedes llevar la sorpresa que te los envien los defectuosos!!!!",3

This phone has everything she wanted + a little more. At first there was an issue w/ the phone shutting off after 'waking up' from stand-by mode but I looked into the problem online & found A-LOT of complaints about this very problem. The solution came from an Android forum that said the problem lies w/ when the phone went into sleep mode the WiFi goes off then restarts on wake. I read that if we go into the WiFi menu> advanced settings> WiFi sleep> and select ""Never"" that this should solve the issue. Well it did, I think it shut off maybe once or twice more after selecting ""Never"" in the menu but has completely stopped jamming u[p/shutting off for the month since I'd changed the setting. All in all, a cool little phone w/ a very nice looking and moderately sized screen that looks and acts like a much more expensive full touchscreen smartphone.",2

A nice feature it that charges from the USB port and this is really useful when you hit the road. Screen Protectors and other accessories are very easy to find anywhere.Cons: battery life with BT and WiFi on is hmmmm...poor, you will exhaust a brand-new completely-full battery in less than two hours.

I have my service thru T-Mobile, and I only pay the $30.00 a month plan, I don't see any point in paying for wifi when almost everywhere I go has free wifi. I connect to the free wifi at my job and at my school, even at the grocery store the phone alerted me there was free wifi available ( publix customer wifi), and it automatically connects to my high speed when I'm home. I haven't had any dropped calls and the call clarity is great, I'm not sure if that's due to T-mobile or the phone. I was using net-10 before (with a different phone) and I could never hear anyone. All of the apps work great on this phone, too. So I'm really completely happy with it, no complaints here.",4
Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,4,"This is not a bad phone, but there is limited memory and many apps do not store on SD card. This makes it run slow. Also, this version has font problems with Asian languages. If you plan to use in different countries, other than European ones, you may have difficulties even after installing local font software. Samsung dealers in Asia said this problem can be fixed, but at the risk of losing all data already on the phone. A nearly identical Samsung phone, the Galaxy Cooper, can be purchased in Asia.",
Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,4,"I am a long time Palm Pilot user who is moving to a Smartphone, and I chose this because I wanted an unlocked phone that I could use through NET10 or some other provider that does not lock you into a contract.At this point, my phone works fine and I'm pleased with the purchase. However, it was not a ""plug and play"" process and I made one mistake. The description of this product didn't make it clear which size SIM card you need. For this model, you need the larger sized SIM card (I think it's called a mini card) from your carrier, and the smaller sized card (micro card?) for additional storage (optional). That mistake cost me $15 but not a significant tragedy.In my case, the provider also didn't seem to know how to get this phone to use the data services needed for internet connections or apps without using wi-fi. Once I read up on GSM networks and saw that it's a 2G technology, I remembered an option in settings for ""only use 2G connections."" Once I tried that option, I had could browse the Internet.The GPS capability and the Navigation app are very nice. It works well enough for me in the car (especially with a slip case that prevents the phone from slipping around on my leg or car seat).It seemed a little rocky at first but I think that anybody with some tech savvy and some patience can get this phone set up. If you're not technically inclined, I'd recommend either going for a locked phone from a traditional carrier or finding somebody who can help you out.",2

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,5,this item expired my expectations. i choose this rating because it deserves it. and its just what i expected from this.,0
Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,3,"Positive side:- I ordered the phone on January 21 in the evening. And, I received it in Florida today January 24. The estimated delivery time was between Tuesday, January 28, 2014 and Wednesday, February 12. So, this was a good surprise.- The phone looks OK. I still need to test its proper functioning over a long period. But, all looks fine to me so far.Negative side:- The instructions book cover is in French. However, because I speak and read French, this was of no problem to me.- But, the instructions are in German - no French and no English. And, I don't speak nor write German. I downloaded the instructions from the Web. This German instructions booklet with a French cover is odd. I would like to make sense out of it.- I found no list of the parts included in the package. There may be some parts missing, but I wouldn't know it. An exhaustive list is only standard for any phone.- One of the plastic wraps containing small parts was visibly torn open. There may have been some tampering and some parts missing. How do I know?- I was expecting a 2 GB SD card included as described on the gsmarena dot com website. Their description concerns the US market. There is none. So, It may be missing, but I wouldn't know since there is no list of the included parts. Samsung typically includes a small SD memory. Anyhow, this does not appear to be a phone initially destined for the US region. Features may be lesser.- I didn't find a clear mention of the seller's company whereabouts in the package.- I find no mention of the warranty, and no warranty card as is to be expected with a Samsung phone.- A flyer was included in the package. It mentions: ""Leave a positive feedback within 7 days of delivery to extend your warranty to 45 days"". I don't buy into that. I realize that I was influenced in my choice of vendor by the positive reviews. This may explain that.Conclusion:It's too early to jump to a conclusion. But, I find these unprofessional practices not reassuring. I have doubts as to whether my phone is a legit unlocked new phone and not a refurbished one or a manufacturer's defective series. The instruction manual in German with a French cover is a good indication it is. This should be mentioned in the Amazon product description.",0
Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,5,Very good phone. This item was bought over a year ago and is used by my daughter. The only issue she has with it is that the battery seems to be wearing. She has to be removing it and putting back in on a regular basis,0

Dropping the phone once or some other accident, I could imagine that being the end of a working phone.In addition, it is yet another phone I had to return because it could not be activated by page plus; it had an IMEI number instead of an MEID number on the back.

I contacted Blutekusa, the seller, and their response was that they had never heard of someone being charged $75.00 to unlock a cell phone. I sent Blutekusa a copy of the invoice. They were not willing to make me whole even though it was their fault I found myself without a working cell phone in a foreign country, the sole reason I bought the cell phone in the first place. I can understand that a mistake was made, we, as humans are not perfect, but they know they made a mistake and they are not willing to accept responsibility.

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,2,"From the start, it exhibited a number of big problems.

There is a phone number you can type in to restart the driver and fix it, but it was happening so often that it was unacceptable.Second, calls. Even with full signal and all, for some reason, the phone simply wouldn't make calls. You would dial a number, and it would hang up before the call even began. I tried everything and to no avail.Third: the phone kept shutting itself off. Randomly, the screen would go black and I would have to turn it on again. It was aggravating and made the phone rather unusable.Overall I think that if these bugs were fixed, it would be a fine entry-to-mid-level Android phone.

El touch screen es realmente bueno, sobre todo para alguien como yo que en su vida hab√≠a probado un celular o cualquier equipo touch screen, despu√©s de un ratito te acostumbras ;) el √∫nico inconveniente que le veo hasta ahora y no es realmente un inconveniente es que el equipo no me vino con una targeta micro sd como es la costumbre en este tipo de equipos, y sin esta sencillamente no puedes disfrutar de este como se debe, si es posible y lo consigues traten de obtener una memoria micro sd que sea por lo menos clase 6 y con las debidas configuraciones tendr√°s un equipo demasiado buenooooooo.En definitiva la relaci√≥n precio/valor de este celular es una de las mejores que hay actualmente en el mercado, antes de comprarlo realice una b√∫squeda realmente extensa para tomar una decisi√≥n acertada y lo hice.

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,3,"Have two of these phones for a couple of weeks. One phone works perfectly, no issue whatsoever. The other one has the SOD ' Sleep of Death' issue multiple times. SOD = phone shuts itself off. Google solutions and tried them all but nothing works. Downloaded the lastest OS - Gingerbread 2.3.4 thru Samsung Kies but issue remains. This one is going back for an exchange. Neither of the phone is rooted.Overall I really like the phone, value vs. price and I think you are not going to get a better deal. A good beginner android phone that is almost iphone like.Pros: Screen size 3.5"" is perfect for me. The overall phone size isn't too big either. Plenty of free apps to download. Gingerbread improves the battery life.Cons: Internal memory is small. You won't be able to download a lot of apps. And you can't install the apps to the external SD card unless you root the phone (become a superuser) but that immediately voids the warranty. I read somewhere that you can un-root the phone if needed... Last minor issue, the touch screen isn't as sensitive as I like it but this could be the problem with having a Zagg shield on.Update 9/9/11: Received the replacement but it is also going back to Amazon. This time I didn't even power up the phone, the problem is on the touchscreen, there are 6 spots (about the size of a dime) that cannot be cleaned, looks like it is actually on the other side of screen. This is really getting old, all I want is another phone withour issue. And dealing with the exchange process is a nightmare.

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,3,"The product was shipped on time and in perfect condition. The look and feel is the same as other Andriod phones. The phone is slightly slower then the duo core new Andriods but that's expected as the Galaxy Ace only has one CPU. I bought this phone so that I can have an Andriod to use when I travel out of the US.The first problem I face was it comes with the language preset to Spanish. The manual that comes in the box is also Spanish so that didn't help. Luckily, after some guessing at the setting options I finally found the language setting and selected English. First problem solved. Actually an easier way is to have a friend who has an English Andriod so you can follow his setting tree and find the language setting without guessing.Then I have to download the English manual. The Samsung US site does not even recognize the S5830M model number. I had to go to the Samsung UK site with this url to download the English mauual:[...]. Second problem solved.I set up the phone according to the manual and registered with AT&T. But then I found I cannot get to the Internet when I'm not on wi-fi. That is not good as I cannot use the free GPS without Internet. I brought the phone to an experienced tech who specilizes in connecting unlocked phones and finally I'm enjoying the whole phone.I would have given it 4 stars if the phone comes set in English and duo languange manuals which is usuall for phones sold in the US. The problem with AT&T is AT&T's and does not count in here. I would have given it 5 stars if it is faster, but at the Amazon price I'm not complaining.Good luck connecting your phone to other carriers, Perhaps they may be less restrictive with their connection.",3

My new battery within less than one year wasnt keeping charge either. Used it for 10 mins or less and the alert says battery is low plug in.The other thing was no manual came with it. I was left to research online to navigate. That is not my only issue I have noticed that its not picking up the local frequency/network that I use in my country it is always saying ""Emergency call Only"" or ""no signal"". Therefore I am stuck with a phone that only uses the wifi for communication no calls or texts on my local carrier.

The phone started overheating and going into endless rebooting loops. After contacting Amazon, I was instructed to contact the vendor.I reached out to FGS Trading in an effort to help me with a warranty claim, but they informed me they will not handle any claims as my report was over 30 days from purchase date and to contact Samsung.Samsung refused to replace or to fix my phone as this is an International version.I did a factory reset and after one day of semi-normal operation, the phone died on me and wouldn't restart at all. After continues attempts and plugging the charger (after the phone was 100% chanrged, I was able to get the phone to restart once gain doing a hardkey reset. I did another factory reset to erase anything that might have been left from the first factory reset I did yesterday.My phone has just a couple of apps (Whatsap, Viber, XE (currency exchange), and my bank's app).I am VERY upset. Nobody wants to help me and now I have a $700 brick metal with a glass screen that don't work.I will make sure I never buy from FGS Trading and I will submit a report of their lack of care to the BBB. I plan on pointing the finger also at Amazon - I have been a long-lasting customer, given their normal support for people that live and work overseas (Afghanistan in my case). However, this time that I need help with a broken item I bought through them, I get no support. Wonderful!",0

What a fantastic phone! The camera itself leaves my Galaxy S5 (and any model iPhone) in the dust. I will leave the details to other reviewers, but just a couple of comments on the Dual-SIM version which I bought:(a) It doesn't say you have to, but I powered off the phone before putting SIMs in. Why take a chance?(b) Both SIM's sit in the same tray, and you have to be careful that SIM 2 is still seated all the way as you push the tray back in. Any resistance, STOP, and check that everything is seated. By the way, an important note: You may NOT have a second SIM and a microSD card in the phone at the same time - they use the same slot! I don't care about this (yet), as 32GB should be enough memory, but this gave me pause.(c) You can select the default SIM to use separately for each important function: outbound Voice and Text, and data. This is a nice feature, but it's still possible to override these selections when making an outbound call, so you can get mixed up. There is also an on/off function for each SIM which prevents this, as a safety in preventing very high roaming charges!If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't get the silver color. Although it still looks classy, it also looks like a run-of-the-mill iPhone 6 haha. I liked the electric blue color on my S5 better (not available on the S7, as far as I know) - just had more of a wow factor.",7

"Samsung S7 Galaxy Smartphone Unlocked 32Gb Black, US Warranty (SM-G930UZKAXAA) and Samsung Fast Charge Qi Wireless Charging Pad",,594.52,5,"Should I buy the Samsung Galaxy S7?I am speaking of the Asian version with duo slots not the north American version.I had an iphone 6s , went overseas to work for a few months I was using the iPhone 6s it worked fine , except for a 4G connection and lte use overseas , I called apple ask them what type of bug they put in their phone for limiting service providers on the speed of the Internet, they did not fix an issue which I am not going to details about an apple freak would know the problem my of the public is not aware about . Any way I did a lot of reading and research on the better phone . I came across the Samsung s7 specifically the Asian version . At first I was very hesitant about getting it , I was not convinced till I tested the phone now I am convinced it is the world's most fastest phone to surf the net .I have put up a screen shot of the proforma center and no restrictions like Apple on network speed . Now I have placed my iPhone 6s as a paper weight . There goes apple support. The fix is the Samsung s7 . Yes it works well in Africa , Asia, Europe in any network without a certifications need without carrier is not certified issue unlike like Apple.There isn‚Äôt a better Android phone out there right now. The Nexus 6P comes close, but it‚Äôs much larger, and the Galaxy S7 Edge is a lot more expensive. For the majority of people, I‚Äôd say the Galaxy S7 is the phone to pick.It looks great, feels a lot better than the Galaxy S6 due to the curved back, and it performs like a champ.It also has the best all-round camera on any phone, thanks to crisp images and a fuss-free app that‚Äôs fast to open, focus and shoot.Samsung has taken the Galaxy S6, an already excellent phone, and fixed just about everything wrong with it. UPDATE .. dated 28-7-2016 , if you buy this phone get a cover and a screen protector , I accidentally dropped the phone from a 2 meter escalator facing the screen head on the phone survived the fall with a single shatter on the screen , still working but the shatter is visible from an angle, I purchased a screen seal so the shatter won't spread all over , I did a search on replacing the screen , no one is willing to replace the screen due to some type of a glue on the system Board, I have to wait until a phone technicians know to prefect a replacement screen on the s7 and 7edge. I would not take the star due to my fault . Be careful not to drop the phone on a hard surface , prone to shatter if not protected !! Like any other smart phones . I did get the cracked Glass on the front replaced with no hassle . The waiting was about 3 hours at the Samsung center in bejing , it can out like new , no cracks that bothered me for a while , I had to pay for the service of replacement on the front Glass, now learned , I did get a screen protector and a solid cover . If you buy a glass shatter phone it is a must to buy the cover and glass shield.. love the phone as far as proformance and speed ..Here we go apple .. watch out ..",12

"Samsung S7 Galaxy Smartphone Unlocked 32Gb Black, US Warranty (SM-G930UZKAXAA) and Samsung Fast Charge Qi Wireless Charging Pad",,594.52,3,"It seems that most of these unlocked international version phones are unlocked by the sellers themselves, who break the phone's box seal, open the box, and unlock the phones themselves (note that Samsung says ""do not accept if seal is broken""). Hence, technically, most of these unlocked international version phones are not really new. I bought a lot of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phones from Amazon, and most (not all) had the seal broken.On the phone itself, this is the best phone I have ever tried. Slick, light, balanced, fantastic screen, fast, water proof, and so on .... its only caveat (and an important one) is the lack of removable battery (Samsung lost the removable batter starting with the S6). I like this phone much better than the Edge. The S7 Edge has a bigger screen, but the resolution is the same as with the S7, and its edges are highly annoying, making one touch them by mistake constantly. Furthermore, the Edge's edges make it very difficult to properly protect the phone with a case - not a problem with the regular S7.Finally, the only difference between the G930F (single sim version) and the G930FD (dual sim version) is that in the latter the slot where the micro card goes is also enabled to accept a second sim card, which is recognized by the device's OS.",168

"Samsung S7 Galaxy Smartphone Unlocked 32Gb Black, US Warranty (SM-G930UZKAXAA) and Samsung Fast Charge Qi Wireless Charging Pad",,594.52,5,"This is a review for SM-G930UZKAXAA. The ONLY non-carrier based, Samsung U.S. warranted, factory unlocked phone. Too bad Amazon lumps all the 'unlocked' S7 reviews together. This was very confusing as I gradually figured out that numerous overseas and carrier based versions of the S7 exist. I won't waste time reviewing the phone itself other than the primary differences that this version has.1) - It is has both CDMA and GSM receivers optimized for the bands and channels used by U.S. carriers. In the U.S., Sprint, Verizon and U.S. Cellular use CDMA. AT&T and T-mobile use GSM. I.E. - it is theoretically compatible with any U.S. carrier allowing you to take your phone to any U.S. carrier including the pay as you go services such as Cricket, Boost, Virgin, etc. Set up flawlessly on my Cricket account.2) It does not come pre-loaded with carrier bloatware. Although Samsung does load some of its own that can't be removed. The most irritating being Samsung pay which occasionally generates popups reminding you its available.3) It is warranted by SAMSUNG with full U.S. warranty. No battery issues on the S7, but nice to know it's warranted if something similar to the Note 7 debacle happens.4) Updates are pushed out directly from Samsung. Presumably at a quicker pace than from many experience from carrier versions. I have received one update so far in 60 days.",162

At this point, on the second day after getting it, I am forced to take it in to a repair shop and see if it is able to be fixed.

After starting to think I was crazy, I googled the problem and then called Verizon, and indeed, Verizon does not support Wi-Fi calling on this phone because it is unlocked. It would have been nice for the specs to say that. And also, speaking of the specs, even though I am on Verizon, I note that while this phone is advertised for all US carriers, it is missing band 17 for AT&T users.Lastly, the phone is very hot while just sitting there untouched, and in the two hours I spent setting it up, I watched the battery drop from 100% (I had fully charged it when it arrived) to 52%.

This model should work on all major carrier's (even quite a few of the minor names as well).This phone feels pro. The camera quality is the best I have ever seen and it was the main reason for buying this phone. In 5 years I don't want to look back and think that I should have spent the extra money for quality pictures of my kids. The s7 has me covered there.

What a fantastic phone! The camera itself leaves my Galaxy S5 (and any model iPhone) in the dust. I will leave the details to other reviewers, but just a couple of comments on the Dual-SIM version which I bought:(a) It doesn't say you have to, but I powered off the phone before putting SIMs in. Why take a chance?(b) Both SIM's sit in the same tray, and you have to be careful that SIM 2 is still seated all the way as you push the tray back in. Any resistance, STOP, and check that everything is seated. By the way, an important note: You may NOT have a second SIM and a microSD card in the phone at the same time - they use the same slot! I don't care about this (yet), as 32GB should be enough memory, but this gave me pause.(c) You can select the default SIM to use separately for each important function: outbound Voice and Text, and data. This is a nice feature, but it's still possible to override these selections when making an outbound call, so you can get mixed up. There is also an on/off function for each SIM which prevents this, as a safety in preventing very high roaming charges!If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't get the silver color. Although it still looks classy, it also looks like a run-of-the-mill iPhone 6 haha. I liked the electric blue color on my S5 better (not available on the S7, as far as I know) - just had more of a wow factor.",7

The phone memory is not great at all but I use external storage so it matters very little. The touch screen keyboard has a learning curve for those with large fingers. The free hand write mode is fantastic. Only down fall with this phone for me is it is not voice activated and it does not seem to have speed dial. I think that the memory , it being non voice activated and possibly non speed dial should be stated in the description of the phone. I would purchase for a family member or friend",1

I purchased this as a gift for someone in the Dominican Republic and there was no trouble getting service from a local supplier.The phone requires a micro sd card if you want to save music and photos, etc. That does not come with the phone so should be purchased at same time, unless you already have a card you can move from another phone.",13

Samsung SA-S5260WESP Cellphone - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - White,Samsung,65.55,5,"This phone is really good. The screen is capacitive, unlike the previous Samsung star, so it's really easy to use. The music player is great, and the phone supports multi-tasking (though it drags the performance down a bit). Perhaps my favorite feature about this phone is the WiFi. For those of you who don't have a data plan, and don't plan on getting one for the future, the WiFi is a really nice touch because it allows you to browse the internet without being forced in a 2-year contract. Most of the phone that have wifi are smartphone, which carriers are requiring a data plan with, but this phone is a feature phone. wifi is a great ""feature"" on a ""dumbphone"". The only problem I have with this phone is the annoying QWERTY keypad while texting. The keys are really small, and I frequently press the ""back"" key instead of the ""backspace"" key. I'm getting used to it though, and it's also helpful that this phone has a feature that is similar to android's ""swype"", where you slide your finger across the keyboard to type. the internet browser is good, and the phone supports youtube videos. the quality isn't the greatest for videos that have a lot of action, but for the occasional stand-up comedian video, this phone performs sufficiently. the phone sports a micro sd card slot, so I can load all my music on the card and play it on the phone. I have at&t in the us, and the phone started working immediately after i put the sim card in it. the batter life is above average, but it doesn't blow you away. overall, i'm very happy with this phone.",24

Samsung SA-S5260WESP Cellphone - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - White,Samsung,65.55,1,Nothing works right and it has a mind of its own,0
Samsung SA-S5260WESP Cellphone - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - White,Samsung,65.55,4,"Want to start off by introducing myself. I am a 19 year old male who enjoys technology. I am NOT a heavy user (maybe 90 minutes a day using my phone except for 6-8 hours playing music), but I do spend very many hours with a new device learning every nook and cranny of it as quickly as possible.This phone is a very interesting phone. The layout is VERY similar to a smartphone, however it is NOT a smartphone at all. It is what is called a feature phone; one of the smartest and most advanced ones made as of 2013. It feels a bit smallish. To give you an idea of the size of the screen, take a 3X5 index card (the kind with lines) and fold it in thirds (90¬∞ angle to the lines). Now ‚Ä¶ cut off one of the thirds and trim off the top of the card along the red line. This is the exact size of the screen. 2 stars for screen size. It's way too small. The battery life though, probably due in part to the screen size and basic-ness of the phone, is incredible!!!! If you use your phone heavily, as in all day long from 6AM until midnight, you can use it all day without a charge. If you don't use your phone much, it can go MANY days without a charge. I think I have had up to about 4 days on my phone, but I tend to have it running a good bit for music over headphones. 5 stars for the battery life!Here is a list of the built-in features:- texting (conversation layout. Relies on the memory capacity of the phone's built-in storage. If you intend to text on this phone but also have media stored on it too, PURCHASE A MEMORY CARD!!!!! It supports multimedia messages. I am running T-Mobile on it and I have NOT been able to successfully send any multimedia as of yet. I can however receive all of them. This is a carrier problem, not a phone problem. The touch screen keyboard however is very difficult to use. I love touchscreens (I have an iPod touch, an iPhone, and have handled MANY MANY different smartphones. This is the most difficult touchscreen keyboard I have ever used. It can be used but it is difficult and will slow you down. Use with patience. Calibration (at least with this phone) may be off slightly and differs with each key. Small size doesn't help any. It is NOT impossible to use and I have gotten SIGNIFICANTLY better with it over the past month. 3 stars for texting and keyboard.- calling (supports 3+ way calling, however I have never needed to use this feature so I cannot review this feature. Calling is pretty good but not excellent. At times especially at the beginning of a call I can faintly hear my voice with varying lag times, from nearly at the same time, to up to a second behind. 4 stars for calling.- connectivity. Yes it has wifi. It's good, however it will not be anything different than its 3G connection. And it's basic 3G, nothing fancy. Not too fast but works okay. 4 stars for connectivity, both for 3G and wifi- Screenshots!!!!!! :) push the bottom middle button and the power button on the top right side at the same time.- FM radio, a very good one at that. Must use headphones for radio to work. It records too! Excellent quality recordings. Very high quality. What you hear on the radio is exactly what the recording will be. In fact if you use the music player to play back your recordings, it has an audio plack mode called 5.1CH. I don't know what that stands for, but it makes the tones sound deep and rich. I cannot gett over the quality of the output. 5 stars for the radio!- Music player. Exactly the same look and layout of a Samsung Galaxy. It plays much better and significantly louder than almost any other feature phone. I have owned 6 feature phones in my life. This one is the best one for music. 5 stars for the music player! Just be sure to purchase a memory card.- Camera. Rear-facing only. 3.2mp (megapixels), no flash. It's actually pretty good for what it is. Max resolution is 2048X1536. Here is the resolution list in MP settings ‚Ä¶ 3.2, 2.4, 2, 1.5, 1.3, and 2 for 0.1 mp: 400X240 and 320X240. The camera is highly customizable both before and after the picture is taken. It is full of very very many different editing options (for one who has the time to fish around for the fun of it) but they are all basic in nature. You can change color schemes, sharpen and blur images, even add basic clip art, words, and change font and color of words! It is an absolute blast to play with the camera. 5 stars for the camera!!!!!!!- Web browser. No exaggeration folks, but it stinks. Possibly the worst browser I've ever had. Most sites CANNOT load completely. It says it has run out of memory. The browser is sickeningly depressing. One star. However, it CAN DO YOUTUBE and it operates nicely on that site!!!!! (VERY WEIRD) The audio quality is somewhat poor and slightly garbled, and the videos aren't very clear and they are kind of grainy, but for how poor this browser is, it's shocking that it works!!!! It runs quickly and smoothly. 3 stars for YouTube.- Calculator. Very very good for a feature phone!!!! Comes with many features!!!! You can even scroll through all your old calculations! It is however a European phone and the decimals ‚Ä¶ are, well, ‚Ä¶ commas. Kind of different, but not bad! 5 stars for calculator hands-down! Incredible!Dictionary. Lots of words, a few unusual ones, but chances are that if you are a person with a very good education, and you need to reach for the dictionary, you will only find your word half the time. The definitions are broken down into extremely simple terms. EXAMPLE:Complicated: If you say that something is complicated, you mean it has so many parts or aspects that it is difficult to understand or deal with.And then there are examples of uses of the word. 4 stars for dictionary.- Notes. Good for what it is for. Basic. No need to elaborate. 3 stars because of keyboard.- clock, alarm clock, stopwatch, tasks ‚Ä¶ they all work very well. 5 stars.- calendar. Very good! Lots of things you can do with it. Very much like an iPhone calendar! 5 stars.- have not used twitter Facebook or all that other social media stuff. Cannot write a review on that- email. Plugged in all the correct information and it refused to work on both 3G and on wifi. Phone problem, not carrier or my fault.- Voice memos. Works as good as any other device. They are all almost the same. Records for 12 hours. 4 stars??? I don't know. Hard to say for sure.- Samsung apps and widget store. Blah. Stinks. Very little stuff at all. Most of it can't even be downloaded. Sometimes the very basic site itself can't even load because it says not enough memory. 1 star.- Games. Can download and run any 240X400 J2ME app for touchscreen phones. Expect only the most basic functionality of it though. The best place I have found for these apps is a place called umnet.com. Be sure to do your browsing on the COMPUTER!!!!! This phone can't load that site. There is a download page the phone can use and it is umnet.net instead. Have fun. 4 stars, but keep in mind, it's 4 stars for what it is DESIGNED to do, not for how good it is compared to a smartphone!!!!!!Well that's about it! If you are going to PURCHASE this phone, here are some helpful tips. The phone kind of has TWO DIFFERENT screen formats, each with their own style, format, layout, whatever you call it. When you ""slide to unlock"" the first thing you will see is a background with these app-lookin thingies called widgets. These make your phone run heavy, however they can be helpful little tools. These are downloaded from the samsung App Store. These can be added and removed by tapping the widget button on the top left of the screen. A row of app icons will appear at the bottom of the screen. Those are all your widgets. You can scroll through those. To open them, slide them vertically out of the row and onto the screen. To close them, slide them off the screen down into the little scrolling row. To edit the number of screens, STILL IN WIDGET MODE, turn the screen horizontally (landscape mode) the + signs add screens, the delete symbols delete screens. Press the done button when you are finished with your editing.The other apps screen is when you push the middle home button. These are all your real apps I wrote a review on. These CANNOT be moved to your widget screen. To leave the apps screen press the end call button on the right side of the middle button. When you open an app if you press the home button it takes you to the apps screen and the power button takes you to the widgets screen. Many apps can all run at the same time. To force close programs, hold down the home button. Tap the delete button to force close.On any screen if you run your finger from the very top of the screen downward, it opens your notification and quick settings tab. You can turn on and off wifi, Bluetooth, and silent mode from here. Also if you have your music or radio running, all that can be changed from here as well ‚Ä¶ change track, play and pause, and change frequency or pause radio in the radio.",1

It worked alright for a few weeks, didn't hold much charge, but that is understandable for a used battery. It would occasionally freeze and require restarting, and the screen sometimes didn't load properly. After a few weeks it wouldn't charge at all. I tried an old charger that fit, and while it turned on one last time, it was barely functional, and completely gave up on me later that day.I knew I couldn't expect much from a used phone, but this was still a let down and ended up being a waste of money.",1

Samsung SCH-i545 - Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone - Verizon + GSM - Blue (Certified Refurbished),,569.98,3,"Based on all of the previous reviews I read, buying this phone was really a gamble. I read both excellent and terrible comments, and with that knowledge I had assumed there would be both good and bad devices Samsung is sending out there. I took the gamble and unfortunately was hurt by it.First off, the phone came in excellent condition. You probably wouldn't be able to distinguish it from a brand new model. It fired up without a hitch, and everything about it honestly worked perfectly. Then sadly after 2 days the display suddenly stopped working. I would press the power button, the phone would vibrate, capacitive LED's would alight, the screen would ""flicker"" with light and then go blank. This happened while on the road, and it just so happened that I received a call while driving. I answered the call through my car's steering wheel via blutooth so to my estimation the rest of the phone was functioning normally; it was just the display.I was sent a return label by the warranty center without question, and I am expecting to send the phone off within the hour.Would I purchase this product again? I actually think I would. While the phone was working, it handled remarkably. I'm convinced this was just a defective model. I'll be sure to update this review once I receive my new model. Here's to hoping the next one lasts a bit longer.",1
Samsung SCH-i545 - Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone - Verizon + GSM - Blue (Certified Refurbished),,569.98,4,"So far I have had no issues with this phone. Considering how expensive phones are I'm quite happy with this one. I was nervous because it was refurbished. When the phone arrived it was completely dead. I plugged it in and it charged pretty quickly. Once charged I put in my Sim card and viola it worked (I have verizon). I generally go with Verizon free phones when my contract renews but I broke my last phone 1 year into it and I didn't have insurance, oops. My other phones were too old to reuse so I took a chance and I'm not disappointed. The biggest selling point for me was the warranty on this phone. It may not be a long warranty but if they're willing to back they're product then it can't be that bad, right?",1

Samsung SCH-i545 - Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone - Verizon + GSM - Blue (Certified Refurbished),,569.98,3,"1st, I love the phone. It works exactly as expected, as if it were brand new but....the charger that it came with did not charge the phone. Not a huge deal as I have a million charging cables laying around. 2nd, this is not a GSM unlocked device. If using a service that uses GSM radio waves such as AT&T, T-Mobile or Tracfone be sure to ask for a CDMA sim card or you will not be able to make or send texts (although you'll be able to receive them...how frustrating.) It is a Verizon phone that uses CDMA radio waves so you need the CDMA sim card. Just a heads up as it's caused me 2 days worth of headaches just trying to figure it out.",1

Samsung SCH-i545 - Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone - Verizon + GSM - Blue (Certified Refurbished),,569.98,3,"Bought it to be a replacement for my current traveling companion: a Samsung Galaxy Player 5. (The Player is not a phone, and I didn't buy the S4 to be a phone, so I probably didn't have to bother buying ""unlocked"", but that's my problem). The physical screen sizes of the two devices are identical, but obviously the greater resolution on the S4 was the big selling point to me for what I thought would be a simple hardware refresh.I knew going in that I was trading in two rear-facing speakers (GP5) for one (GS4). I didn't know that the S4 just can't get the same volume as the Player5. So it won't be useful for music or vid without earbuds. I also didn't realize that there's no GPS on the S4 - again, my bad. I should have looked harder than I did at the S4's specs. The S4 relies for network feedback to establish location. The Amazon description said the S4's OS would be 4.2.2, consistent with the OS info listed at Best Buy's website (the retailer for which these blue i545s were exclusively made). But it arrived with KitKat (4.4.2), which is probably fine for most people in the unlocked market, but I still don't like it. It's going to present problems with SD card access and how I use several of my music and reading apps - problems with which I'm already familiar and which prompted me to buy a piece of hardware sooner rather than waiting it out for lower prices later: I wanted something before everything is shipped with KitKat or later.FInally, power. For running it Wi-Fi only, the back of the S4 got warm to the touch after minimal use, and I went from a fully charged 100% battery to 79% in practically no time at all. I had already ordered a replacement battery directly from Verizon, so we'll see if a new battery makes a difference in drain. I'll mod the review if it behaves better.On the upside: it obviously takes way better pictures than the Galaxy Player; the higher resolution makes reading a treat; it includes Samsung's multi-app bar which allows you to run two apps simultaneously; the light weight makes it that much better for mobile use; an OS beyond the Player5's hard-limit Gingerbread opens up a wider assortment of apps, and who wouldn't like 2GB RAM instead of 0.5, right? (Just trying to look on the bright side, I guess...)",4

Samsung SCH-i545 - Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone - Verizon + GSM - Blue (Certified Refurbished),,569.98,1,"I bought this phone, and was initially very happy. It's just as advertised, no cosmetic problems, right storage size. But the battery is terrible. Firstly, it came with a fake battery that wasn't made by Samsung. It said it was ""manufactured by elentec""? I've never heard of it and its clearly unofficial.I bought an official battery from a local tech store, but the poor battery life wasn't fixed. The phone discharges by 50% over the course of the day even if you're not using it. It just drains so heavily for no reason. I know it's the phone, as I've used two different batteries and disabled any kind of background applications.Under any heavy use, the battery life just disappears and the phone gets horribly hot. Making a phone call is actually unpleasant as the phone touching my face is so hot.All in all the phone is fine, but this battery life is just so poor. Buying this phone is kind of a hit or miss; it seems you can get a working one or a dud. As I can't afford a better seller, I'm not returning it, but a portable charger is basically a requirement with this phone.As an example, my phone lost 9% charge as I was writing this review on it. The whole process was fifteen minutes.",0
Samsung SCH-i545 - Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone - Verizon + GSM - Blue (Certified Refurbished),,569.98,5,"This phone fully met my expectations. I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 that my employer provides, but I wanted stash my work phone in a drawer on weekends and use a personal smart phone. I've been so pleased with the S4 that I didn't want to chance any other phone. The S4 I bought is a factory refurbished phone and it revealed no blemishes or wear when I got it. The only difference between this phone and my work phone is that this one is white while the other is black. I believe that the 4 is an ideal size -- large enough to read easily and view visuals, but not too large for my pocket. The best feature of the S4 is that it takes incredible photographs. For this reason I often leave my digital SLR camera at home when I travel knowing that I can capture superb photos without the weight and bulk of my large camera (the SLR however, is more versatile will take some kinds of photos better). The Samsung Galaxy 5 is larger than the 4 overall, but the screen is no larger, so I didn't waste my money getting the new model. The Galaxy 6 is almost too large and much more expensive than the S4.",17

It works well, on a 100% charge and frequent use I can probably get 7-14 hours out of it, but it is definitely evident that it is not a new battery and it has been used a bit, nothing surprising there. Of course you should be cautious and keep in mind that you never know what kind of wear the phone and the battery have had, you might get stuck with a almost dead battery that will most likely frustrate you.I would however recommend the phone to anyone that is looking for an advanced working smartphone at a low budget.Chears",0

The functionality of this phone is a breeze to learn. I came from a flip phone where texting was a pain this is so easy to use! Also the graphics are way better. I love the fact that you can upgrade your memory! One big plus!!,0
Samsung SCH-i545 - Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone - Verizon + GSM - Blue (Certified Refurbished),,569.98,4,"The phone arrived in generic packaging. Not in in any type of Samsung packaging. The charger and USB cable are generic. Not a Samsung charger and USB cable. Does not include earbuds. The phone was not advertised to include earbuds but I wrongly assumed earbuds would be included as a new phone would. Out of the box, the phone looks like new. It had no scratches or dings. The screen has a plastic film to protect it from scratches. The phone battery had no charge. I had to charge the phone a bit before turning it on. At first, the charger seemed to charge well and quick. Suddenly, the phone stopped charging. I switched to another charger and the phone charged fine. Tried the charger the phone came with on another phone and there was no charging. I figured I got a defective charger but later I tried the charger again and it charged the phone well and quick again. Don't know what to make of that. Played around with the phone to see how it would respond. Everything worked as it should. Screen resolution is clear, sharp, and bright as Galaxy phones and known for. Pictures look pretty good. Videos look great. Swiping response seemed a little delayed compared to my current Galaxy S6 but then the S4 is a much older model with a slower processor so that may have something to do with slower swipe response. There is a lot of junk apps or software bloat. Usable internal storage after accounting for the manufacturer‚Äôs system software and bloat added for Samsung and Verizon is about 8GB. Luckily, with the older model Galaxy phones, you can add an external sd card for more storage. Max sd card storage on the S4 is 64GB. The S6 and S7 do not have external sd card slots. With those models, you‚Äôre stuck with only internal storage. The S5 is the last model with an SD card slot. I‚Äôd suggest uninstalling apps and software you‚Äôre never going to use. Some apps and software can‚Äôt be uninstalled without rooting the phone which can be complicated and dangerous if you don‚Äôt know how to root a smartphone. For those apps and software, clear the apps cache and data, disable and stop the apps from running. That‚Äôll free up some space but not much. Eventually, you‚Äôll need to add an SD card if you plan on taking lots of pictures and videos. The usable internal storage will be used in no time. The phone was purchased as a gift for someone in the country of Peru. The person that got the phone was able to install a SIM card from a cellular phone company in Peru and so far the phone is working well. I gave the phone 4 stars because it‚Äôs missing the earbuds you‚Äôd normally get with a smartphone and the generic packaging. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a good quality brand phone if you‚Äôre looking to save money over a newer model.",1

It's just as advertised, no cosmetic problems, right storage size. But the battery is terrible. Firstly, it came with a fake battery that wasn't made by Samsung. It said it was ""manufactured by elentec""? I've never heard of it and its clearly unofficial.I bought an official battery from a local tech store, but the poor battery life wasn't fixed. The phone discharges by 50% over the course of the day even if you're not using it. It just drains so heavily for no reason. I know it's the phone, as I've used two different batteries and disabled any kind of background applications.Under any heavy use, the battery life just disappears and the phone gets horribly hot. Making a phone call is actually unpleasant as the phone touching my face is so hot.All in all the phone is fine, but this battery life is just so poor. Buying this phone is kind of a hit or miss; it seems you can get a working one or a dud. As I can't afford a better seller, I'm not returning it, but a portable charger is basically a requirement with this phone.As an example, my phone lost 9% charge as I was writing this review on it.

I believe that the 4 is an ideal size -- large enough to read easily and view visuals, but not too large for my pocket. The best feature of the S4 is that it takes incredible photographs. For this reason I often leave my digital SLR camera at home when I travel knowing that I can capture superb photos without the weight and bulk of my large camera (the SLR however, is more versatile will take some kinds of photos better). The Samsung Galaxy 5 is larger than the 4 overall, but the screen is no larger, so I didn't waste my money getting the new model. The Galaxy 6 is almost too large and much more expensive than the S4.",17

I love the fact that you can upgrade your memory! One big plus!!,0
Samsung SCH-i545 - Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone - Verizon + GSM - Blue (Certified Refurbished),,569.98,4,"The phone arrived in generic packaging. Not in in any type of Samsung packaging. The charger and USB cable are generic. Not a Samsung charger and USB cable. Does not include earbuds. The phone was not advertised to include earbuds but I wrongly assumed earbuds would be included as a new phone would. Out of the box, the phone looks like new. It had no scratches or dings. The screen has a plastic film to protect it from scratches. The phone battery had no charge. I had to charge the phone a bit before turning it on. At first, the charger seemed to charge well and quick. Suddenly, the phone stopped charging. I switched to another charger and the phone charged fine. Tried the charger the phone came with on another phone and there was no charging. I figured I got a defective charger but later I tried the charger again and it charged the phone well and quick again. Don't know what to make of that. Played around with the phone to see how it would respond. Everything worked as it should. Screen resolution is clear, sharp, and bright as Galaxy phones and known for. Pictures look pretty good. Videos look great. Swiping response seemed a little delayed compared to my current Galaxy S6 but then the S4 is a much older model with a slower processor so that may have something to do with slower swipe response. There is a lot of junk apps or software bloat. Usable internal storage after accounting for the manufacturer‚Äôs system software and bloat added for Samsung and Verizon is about 8GB. Luckily, with the older model Galaxy phones, you can add an external sd card for more storage. Max sd card storage on the S4 is 64GB. The S6 and S7 do not have external sd card slots. With those models, you‚Äôre stuck with only internal storage. The S5 is the last model with an SD card slot. I‚Äôd suggest uninstalling apps and software you‚Äôre never going to use. Some apps and software can‚Äôt be uninstalled without rooting the phone which can be complicated and dangerous if you don‚Äôt know how to root a smartphone. For those apps and software, clear the apps cache and data, disable and stop the apps from running. That‚Äôll free up some space but not much. Eventually, you‚Äôll need to add an SD card if you plan on taking lots of pictures and videos. The usable internal storage will be used in no time. The phone was purchased as a gift for someone in the country of Peru. The person that got the phone was able to install a SIM card from a cellular phone company in Peru and so far the phone is working well. I gave the phone 4 stars because it‚Äôs missing the earbuds you‚Äôd normally get with a smartphone and the generic packaging. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a good quality brand phone if you‚Äôre looking to save money over a newer model.",1

I've got it upgraded with an extra 64 GB of storage, which means I can store games as well as more than a just couple of GB of music. I've been able to run KOTOR on it which is cool.",2

Samsung SCH-i545 - Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone - Verizon + GSM - Blue (Certified Refurbished),,569.98,2,05/31/2016: Downgraded rating - The screen on this phone cracked today from a minor fall. Have only been using the phone about two months. My old s4 lasted years.I purchased from Amazon to replace my old s4 with a shattered screen. This phone was only about $30 more then a replacement screen. Works great and allows me to use my existing StraightTalk service,0
Samsung SCH-i545 - Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone - Verizon + GSM - Blue (Certified Refurbished),,569.98,3,"Based on all of the previous reviews I read, buying this phone was really a gamble. I read both excellent and terrible comments, and with that knowledge I had assumed there would be both good and bad devices Samsung is sending out there. I took the gamble and unfortunately was hurt by it.First off, the phone came in excellent condition. You probably wouldn't be able to distinguish it from a brand new model. It fired up without a hitch, and everything about it honestly worked perfectly. Then sadly after 2 days the display suddenly stopped working. I would press the power button, the phone would vibrate, capacitive LED's would alight, the screen would ""flicker"" with light and then go blank. This happened while on the road, and it just so happened that I received a call while driving. I answered the call through my car's steering wheel via blutooth so to my estimation the rest of the phone was functioning normally; it was just the display.I was sent a return label by the warranty center without question, and I am expecting to send the phone off within the hour.Would I purchase this product again? I actually think I would. While the phone was working, it handled remarkably. I'm convinced this was just a defective model. I'll be sure to update this review once I receive my new model. Here's to hoping the next one lasts a bit longer.",1
Samsung SCH-i545 - Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone - Verizon + GSM - Blue (Certified Refurbished),,569.98,4,"So far I have had no issues with this phone. Considering how expensive phones are I'm quite happy with this one. I was nervous because it was refurbished. When the phone arrived it was completely dead. I plugged it in and it charged pretty quickly. Once charged I put in my Sim card and viola it worked (I have verizon). I generally go with Verizon free phones when my contract renews but I broke my last phone 1 year into it and I didn't have insurance, oops. My other phones were too old to reuse so I took a chance and I'm not disappointed. The biggest selling point for me was the warranty on this phone. It may not be a long warranty but if they're willing to back they're product then it can't be that bad, right?",1

I looked at all the phones S5, S6, HTC M9, I phone, and the mid range ones too. What I found was, I'm not paying around $700 for just a minor upgrade from Flagship phones from just two years ago (except Apple, two years ago I don't even think they had a camera or big screen). In addition, to this line of thinking, the S7 is coming in just a few months, so if I'm going to part with that amount of cash I better wait....The Galaxy S4. Has blazing speed, decent camera, and the perfect size, not too mention runs on Lollipop (very smooth). You could even root and change that OS if you choose. I love the expandable memory, and I can swap in fully charged batteries when on the go. All this for less than the brand new mid range phones, that can't even compete with the specs.I made the decision to break from the herd and put my money in women and wine, not my phone and I'm tickled. You will be happy if you do the same.My Cell Phone Profile:I play one game (Madden NFL)30 texts a week avg.I use my phone hotspot and tethering.122gb a month in data (yes unlimited :)I can talk.I take photos of my dog.Great reception while talking and walking my dog along the beach.",41

Then I would dial a number, the person would answer, but could not hear me, nor good I hear them. Sometimes it would ring and after two rings, state call completed and hang up or just stop ringing. The person receiving the call would call me back, my phone rang, I answered, could not hear them and they could not hear me. I went to Verizon, shut the phone off; turned on again and made a call. It worked great again. One more week and same problem occurred. I shut the phone down, started up, made one call successfully and the second call did not go through. Stopped the car, shut down the phone, started up, made one call successfully. Then again it locked up. Decided I had had enough aggrevation with the new Samsung Galaxy 4 that Samsung would not honor the 1 year warranty. The software was bad and had been sent back to Samsung once. They never fixed it and found a hairline 1/8 inch crack at the bottom of the phone that neither the Samsung people at Best Buy nor the Verizon people found during the several trips I took to solve the software problems from the day I bought the phone new from Verizon for $400. I am beginning to think that Samsung has had several ""LEMONS"" in the Galaxy 4 line and now they are on the resale market - factory re certified and if it is Samsung doing the refurbishing; then the phone is never going to work right.

When it got here, it seemed great. However, once my wife started using it more and charging it, she noticed issues with charging. Sometimes it simply won't charge, at least with the majority of cables. I don't know what the issue is, but since my other S4 will charge using all the same cables, it is definitely an issue with the phone. I even tried putting a new battery in it, but still no luck. This is a huge disappointment because my wife already had to go without a phone for longer than guaranteed, but now we will have to buy a new phone and pay again to reactivate the new one.",2

It works well, on a 100% charge and frequent use I can probably get 7-14 hours out of it, but it is definitely evident that it is not a new battery and it has been used a bit, nothing surprising there. Of course you should be cautious and keep in mind that you never know what kind of wear the phone and the battery have had, you might get stuck with a almost dead battery that will most likely frustrate you.I would however recommend the phone to anyone that is looking for an advanced working smartphone at a low budget.Chears",0

I played around with it for a couple hours and i loved it, truly a great phone. Then i saw the battery low and decided to charge it. Little did i know in order to charge it i needed to press the cord in with all my might and hold it there, just to get it to charge. luckily The usb board that needs to be replaced is only $6-$9 to buy and fairly easy to replace. But it makes me wonder how pathetic this company is to call it REFURBISHED when they couldnt even spend 10 bucks to replace the part never buying from them again, and i suggest you do the same. Pay a little extra money and get a new one, that is unless you want to try to fix them yourself.UPDATE you can't replace that part on this specific model .....a total waste of $",

Battery life is disappointing, even after removing all bloatware and disabling everything but Mobile Data. Phone is packed with features though, and the IR Blaster TV remote is holy cow type amazing with the peel smart remote app. Bluetooth reaches over 100 feet in an open air manufacturing plant with lots of interference.

Samsung SCH-i545 - Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone - Verizon + GSM - Blue (Certified Refurbished),,569.98,3,"Bought it to be a replacement for my current traveling companion: a Samsung Galaxy Player 5. (The Player is not a phone, and I didn't buy the S4 to be a phone, so I probably didn't have to bother buying ""unlocked"", but that's my problem). The physical screen sizes of the two devices are identical, but obviously the greater resolution on the S4 was the big selling point to me for what I thought would be a simple hardware refresh.I knew going in that I was trading in two rear-facing speakers (GP5) for one (GS4). I didn't know that the S4 just can't get the same volume as the Player5. So it won't be useful for music or vid without earbuds. I also didn't realize that there's no GPS on the S4 - again, my bad. I should have looked harder than I did at the S4's specs. The S4 relies for network feedback to establish location. The Amazon description said the S4's OS would be 4.2.2, consistent with the OS info listed at Best Buy's website (the retailer for which these blue i545s were exclusively made). But it arrived with KitKat (4.4.2), which is probably fine for most people in the unlocked market, but I still don't like it. It's going to present problems with SD card access and how I use several of my music and reading apps - problems with which I'm already familiar and which prompted me to buy a piece of hardware sooner rather than waiting it out for lower prices later: I wanted something before everything is shipped with KitKat or later.FInally, power. For running it Wi-Fi only, the back of the S4 got warm to the touch after minimal use, and I went from a fully charged 100% battery to 79% in practically no time at all. I had already ordered a replacement battery directly from Verizon, so we'll see if a new battery makes a difference in drain. I'll mod the review if it behaves better.On the upside: it obviously takes way better pictures than the Galaxy Player; the higher resolution makes reading a treat; it includes Samsung's multi-app bar which allows you to run two apps simultaneously; the light weight makes it that much better for mobile use; an OS beyond the Player5's hard-limit Gingerbread opens up a wider assortment of apps, and who wouldn't like 2GB RAM instead of 0.5, right?

Samsung SCH-i545 Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone Verizon + GSM - White (Certified Refurbished),,139.95,4,"The phone arrived in generic packaging. Not in in any type of Samsung packaging. The charger and USB cable are generic. Not a Samsung charger and USB cable. Does not include earbuds. The phone was not advertised to include earbuds but I wrongly assumed earbuds would be included as a new phone would. Out of the box, the phone looks like new. It had no scratches or dings. The screen has a plastic film to protect it from scratches. The phone battery had no charge. I had to charge the phone a bit before turning it on. At first, the charger seemed to charge well and quick. Suddenly, the phone stopped charging. I switched to another charger and the phone charged fine. Tried the charger the phone came with on another phone and there was no charging. I figured I got a defective charger but later I tried the charger again and it charged the phone well and quick again. Don't know what to make of that. Played around with the phone to see how it would respond. Everything worked as it should. Screen resolution is clear, sharp, and bright as Galaxy phones and known for. Pictures look pretty good. Videos look great. Swiping response seemed a little delayed compared to my current Galaxy S6 but then the S4 is a much older model with a slower processor so that may have something to do with slower swipe response. There is a lot of junk apps or software bloat. Usable internal storage after accounting for the manufacturer‚Äôs system software and bloat added for Samsung and Verizon is about 8GB. Luckily, with the older model Galaxy phones, you can add an external sd card for more storage. Max sd card storage on the S4 is 64GB. The S6 and S7 do not have external sd card slots. With those models, you‚Äôre stuck with only internal storage. The S5 is the last model with an SD card slot. I‚Äôd suggest uninstalling apps and software you‚Äôre never going to use. Some apps and software can‚Äôt be uninstalled without rooting the phone which can be complicated and dangerous if you don‚Äôt know how to root a smartphone. For those apps and software, clear the apps cache and data, disable and stop the apps from running. That‚Äôll free up some space but not much. Eventually, you‚Äôll need to add an SD card if you plan on taking lots of pictures and videos. The usable internal storage will be used in no time. The phone was purchased as a gift for someone in the country of Peru. The person that got the phone was able to install a SIM card from a cellular phone company in Peru and so far the phone is working well. I gave the phone 4 stars because it‚Äôs missing the earbuds you‚Äôd normally get with a smartphone and the generic packaging. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a good quality brand phone if you‚Äôre looking to save money over a newer model.",1

So far so good.Now when I transferred the sim card from my other phone, it came on nicely. But when I decided to make a call, it dialed once, then aborted. There was no signal bars. I even went outside on the road and tried dialing again to no avail. My wife then tried calling it with the home phone and it responded but did not ring, just vibrated even though I had set a ring tone.This was too much, because it was supposed to be a birthday gift for my wife. I'm very disappointed. I returned it.",61

Samsung SCH-i545 Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone Verizon + GSM - White (Certified Refurbished),,139.95,2,"Cosmetically the phone looks new..but there's a reason its refurbished. Firstly, when I got the phone it refused to charge.. Just stayed a black screen and vibrated every few seconds. After doing some research it looks like many other people have had this issue with their s4. I finally get it to take a charge and get an error message telling me it will charge very slow because it is not the original charger for the phone. Charged the phone overnight and it didn't do a thing. It stayed at 2%. I then tried it on my computer and it finally charged...but I couldn't use the phone while charging. It wouldn't hold battery life.After a while I realized there is no sim card to the phone...something I thought came with the phone. I've never bought an unlocked phone before so maybe this is norm. This phone is just not worth the hastle and money for me. Currently in the process of returning.",25
Samsung SCH-i545 Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone Verizon + GSM - White (Certified Refurbished),,139.95,5,"I received my factory certified refurbished phone four days ago from Blue-something and couldn't by happier.I had a HTC One, M7 and that was a good phone, but with the two years of heavy use I was ready to get into something different. I looked at all the phones S5, S6, HTC M9, I phone, and the mid range ones too. What I found was, I'm not paying around $700 for just a minor upgrade from Flagship phones from just two years ago (except Apple, two years ago I don't even think they had a camera or big screen). In addition, to this line of thinking, the S7 is coming in just a few months, so if I'm going to part with that amount of cash I better wait....The Galaxy S4. Has blazing speed, decent camera, and the perfect size, not too mention runs on Lollipop (very smooth). You could even root and change that OS if you choose. I love the expandable memory, and I can swap in fully charged batteries when on the go. All this for less than the brand new mid range phones, that can't even compete with the specs.I made the decision to break from the herd and put my money in women and wine, not my phone and I'm tickled. You will be happy if you do the same.My Cell Phone Profile:I play one game (Madden NFL)30 texts a week avg.I use my phone hotspot and tethering.122gb a month in data (yes unlimited :)I can talk.I take photos of my dog.Great reception while talking and walking my dog along the beach.",41

Samsung SCH-i545 Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone Verizon + GSM - White (Certified Refurbished),,139.95,1,"Phone worked great for one week. Then I would dial a number, the person would answer, but could not hear me, nor good I hear them. Sometimes it would ring and after two rings, state call completed and hang up or just stop ringing. The person receiving the call would call me back, my phone rang, I answered, could not hear them and they could not hear me. I went to Verizon, shut the phone off; turned on again and made a call. It worked great again. One more week and same problem occurred. I shut the phone down, started up, made one call successfully and the second call did not go through. Stopped the car, shut down the phone, started up, made one call successfully. Then again it locked up. Decided I had had enough aggrevation with the new Samsung Galaxy 4 that Samsung would not honor the 1 year warranty. The software was bad and had been sent back to Samsung once. They never fixed it and found a hairline 1/8 inch crack at the bottom of the phone that neither the Samsung people at Best Buy nor the Verizon people found during the several trips I took to solve the software problems from the day I bought the phone new from Verizon for $400. I am beginning to think that Samsung has had several ""LEMONS"" in the Galaxy 4 line and now they are on the resale market - factory re certified and if it is Samsung doing the refurbishing; then the phone is never going to work right. I sent the phone back and got a refund.",0

It works exactly as expected, as if it were brand new but....the charger that it came with did not charge the phone. Not a huge deal as I have a million charging cables laying around. 2nd, this is not a GSM unlocked device. If using a service that uses GSM radio waves such as AT&T, T-Mobile or Tracfone be sure to ask for a CDMA sim card or you will not be able to make or send texts (although you'll be able to receive them...how frustrating.) It is a Verizon phone that uses CDMA radio waves so you need the CDMA sim card. Just a heads up as it's caused me 2 days worth of headaches just trying to figure it out.",1

I do thank Amazon for refunding my money even after a couple days after the refund period was over. BUT SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THIS NEW!",0

It's just as advertised, no cosmetic problems, right storage size. But the battery is terrible. Firstly, it came with a fake battery that wasn't made by Samsung. It said it was ""manufactured by elentec""? I've never heard of it and its clearly unofficial.I bought an official battery from a local tech store, but the poor battery life wasn't fixed. The phone discharges by 50% over the course of the day even if you're not using it. It just drains so heavily for no reason. I know it's the phone, as I've used two different batteries and disabled any kind of background applications.Under any heavy use, the battery life just disappears and the phone gets horribly hot. Making a phone call is actually unpleasant as the phone touching my face is so hot.All in all the phone is fine, but this battery life is just so poor. Buying this phone is kind of a hit or miss; it seems you can get a working one or a dud. As I can't afford a better seller, I'm not returning it, but a portable charger is basically a requirement with this phone.As an example, my phone lost 9% charge as I was writing this review on it. The whole process was fifteen minutes.",0
Samsung SCH-i545 Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone Verizon + GSM - White (Certified Refurbished),,139.95,5,"This phone fully met my expectations. I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 that my employer provides, but I wanted stash my work phone in a drawer on weekends and use a personal smart phone. I've been so pleased with the S4 that I didn't want to chance any other phone. The S4 I bought is a factory refurbished phone and it revealed no blemishes or wear when I got it. The only difference between this phone and my work phone is that this one is white while the other is black. I believe that the 4 is an ideal size -- large enough to read easily and view visuals, but not too large for my pocket. The best feature of the S4 is that it takes incredible photographs. For this reason I often leave my digital SLR camera at home when I travel knowing that I can capture superb photos without the weight and bulk of my large camera (the SLR however, is more versatile will take some kinds of photos better). The Samsung Galaxy 5 is larger than the 4 overall, but the screen is no larger, so I didn't waste my money getting the new model. The Galaxy 6 is almost too large and much more expensive than the S4.",17

Samsung SCH-i545 Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone Verizon + GSM - White (Certified Refurbished),,139.95,2,05/31/2016: Downgraded rating - The screen on this phone cracked today from a minor fall. Have only been using the phone about two months. My old s4 lasted years.I purchased from Amazon to replace my old s4 with a shattered screen. This phone was only about $30 more then a replacement screen. Works great and allows me to use my existing StraightTalk service,0
Samsung SCH-i545 Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone Verizon + GSM - White (Certified Refurbished),,139.95,3,"Based on all of the previous reviews I read, buying this phone was really a gamble. I read both excellent and terrible comments, and with that knowledge I had assumed there would be both good and bad devices Samsung is sending out there. I took the gamble and unfortunately was hurt by it.First off, the phone came in excellent condition. You probably wouldn't be able to distinguish it from a brand new model. It fired up without a hitch, and everything about it honestly worked perfectly. Then sadly after 2 days the display suddenly stopped working. I would press the power button, the phone would vibrate, capacitive LED's would alight, the screen would ""flicker"" with light and then go blank. This happened while on the road, and it just so happened that I received a call while driving. I answered the call through my car's steering wheel via blutooth so to my estimation the rest of the phone was functioning normally; it was just the display.I was sent a return label by the warranty center without question, and I am expecting to send the phone off within the hour.Would I purchase this product again? I actually think I would. While the phone was working, it handled remarkably. I'm convinced this was just a defective model. I'll be sure to update this review once I receive my new model. Here's to hoping the next one lasts a bit longer.",1
Samsung SCH-i545 Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone Verizon + GSM - White (Certified Refurbished),,139.95,4,"So far I have had no issues with this phone. Considering how expensive phones are I'm quite happy with this one. I was nervous because it was refurbished. When the phone arrived it was completely dead. I plugged it in and it charged pretty quickly. Once charged I put in my Sim card and viola it worked (I have verizon). I generally go with Verizon free phones when my contract renews but I broke my last phone 1 year into it and I didn't have insurance, oops. My other phones were too old to reuse so I took a chance and I'm not disappointed. The biggest selling point for me was the warranty on this phone. It may not be a long warranty but if they're willing to back they're product then it can't be that bad, right?",1
Samsung SCH-i545 Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone Verizon + GSM - White (Certified Refurbished),,139.95,3,"Received phone and it looked brand new. Perfect cosmetic condition.

The refurbished phone itself is great. Works just like new with no noticeable defects in the first week. I did have an issue with my SIM card hardly receiving 3G, not even registering 4G. I went to Verizon and they replaced the SIM card for free which brought the 4G signal back up. No problems since. Aside from this minor inconvenience (which I have never had with any other used phone) I would rate this as a good purchase.",8

It came in new condition, I'm guessing the back on it was replaced because it looks brand new. There's minor, nearly nonexistent wear on the edges. Front looks brand new. Buttons are functional and not sticky. WiFi works. Android version is a stock Verizon build with Verizon apps. Unfortunately, Amazon's mobile apps come preinstall on it like kindle, amazon app store, etc. This can be disabled through the application manager. The phone required about an hour of software updates to android after turning it on, which is normal for a stock ROM. It came with Samsung ear buds that had some visible use, a Samsung wall outlet with an ASUS data cable. The charger works, no issues yet. The data cable works fine with my computer and prompted to install the phone. Drivers work fine. The Call quality is fine, and speaker phone works. Touch screen is fully responsive. I activated the phone on my Verizon prepaid plan at the store and they put a Sim card in it for free. No issues.",24

It doesn't come with a SIM card, but you just do down to your carrier and they'll give you one and activate the phone for you. Took me about 10 mins. Would definitely recommend.",0

The first thing I heard, the batters went down fast, He put in the battery from his old phone, same problem, then Tues. morning the alarm didn't go off, so he missed his bus, was late for school. Yesterday I tot a text, the phone was messing up, apps wouldn't work, it was overheating got a message to shut now it was overheating. I tried to contact the seller yesterday through face book,no reply. He has to have a phone to call for a ride home as he is taking drivers ed, and the bus leaves when school is out at 2, drivers ed gets out anywhere from 3-4, so no one can plan on when he needs to be picked up. We can't afford a new phone to replace the one that fell from his pocket and broke,",1

Samsung SCH-i545 Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone Verizon + GSM - White (Certified Refurbished),,139.95,3,"Based on all of the previous reviews I read, buying this phone was really a gamble. I read both excellent and terrible comments, and with that knowledge I had assumed there would be both good and bad devices Samsung is sending out there. I took the gamble and unfortunately was hurt by it.First off, the phone came in excellent condition. You probably wouldn't be able to distinguish it from a brand new model. It fired up without a hitch, and everything about it honestly worked perfectly. Then sadly after 2 days the display suddenly stopped working. I would press the power button, the phone would vibrate, capacitive LED's would alight, the screen would ""flicker"" with light and then go blank. This happened while on the road, and it just so happened that I received a call while driving. I answered the call through my car's steering wheel via blutooth so to my estimation the rest of the phone was functioning normally; it was just the display.I was sent a return label by the warranty center without question, and I am expecting to send the phone off within the hour.Would I purchase this product again? I actually think I would. While the phone was working, it handled remarkably. I'm convinced this was just a defective model. I'll be sure to update this review once I receive my new model. Here's to hoping the next one lasts a bit longer.",
Samsung SCH-i545 Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone Verizon + GSM - White (Certified Refurbished),,139.95,4,"So far I have had no issues with this phone. Considering how expensive phones are I'm quite happy with this one. I was nervous because it was refurbished. When the phone arrived it was completely dead. I plugged it in and it charged pretty quickly. Once charged I put in my Sim card and viola it worked (I have verizon). I generally go with Verizon free phones when my contract renews but I broke my last phone 1 year into it and I didn't have insurance, oops. My other phones were too old to reuse so I took a chance and I'm not disappointed. The biggest selling point for me was the warranty on this phone. It may not be a long warranty but if they're willing to back they're product then it can't be that bad, right?",
Samsung SCH-i545 Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone Verizon + GSM - White (Certified Refurbished),,139.95,3,"Received phone and it looked brand new. Perfect cosmetic condition.

I have significant hearing loss and I have not been able to find a more featured model with the same high volume level and sound quality than my original Samsung U540 that I could use on the Verizon network. Very Frustrating. I looked at IPhones, Androids, etc. but the volume is not as loud as this ancient phone. So, I bought two used phones hoping that one would work.

Battery life is two days, my wifes was the same (expect her new one to be no different). Tried new battery's with the same results. Thats if you are mostly on standby and do not play with any of the menu settings or actually get or make some calls. Then it needs recharging daily. The dialup buttons are definitely in the way as they want you online to spend your bucks. Camera is very poor. Bottom line, there's almost no competition nowadays in the sensible dumb phone market, so all in all its not bad. Beats packing something the size of a smart phone around as some of us more mature folks just want to make actual phone calls.

This phone is made of substantial materials and the slide design is very sturdy, plus helps protect the keyboard. I also like how the slide feature elongates the phone, so the mouthpiece is down by my mouth - don't feel like I need to remove the phone from my ear in order to talk into the microphone. And even though it's ""basic"" by today's standards, it has a GPS feature that serves as a 411 or map directions. Nice big screen, easy to view, has the basic camera...

Samsung SGH a777 - Cellular phone - 3G - WCDMA (UMTS) / GSM - slider - Blue - AT&T,Samsung,99.99,4,"I purchased this phone in desperation. Orignally I paid $200.00 for a smartphone but I could not hear the conversation clearly no matter what I did. I also could not hear it ""ring"" even if I put the ""ring"" on the highest volume level and set the profile to ""outdoor"" <= this is the loudest profile available. Aside from being able to hear clearly or even being heard clearly, the monthly cost was $60.00+. The phone was so bad, I gladly paid the $300.00 penalty fee and moved to another carrier whose monthly cost was $10.00/month with a free phone. The free (non-smart) phone met my needs but the speakers in the phone obviously could not handle the loudest setting. (I think they cracked. a clear case of you get what you don't pay for.) Because my current $10/month carrier was ATT (uses SIM CARD), I was limited in my choices for a new phone. That is where the SAMSUNG SGH a777 comes in. For approx. $50.00 I got a phone with potential. I can activate the ""smartphone"" features (data, internet access, email capable, SMS, 3G, etc.)if I wish and if I only want an ""ordinary"" phone, it works just fine. I slipped in my sim card and voila! It worked seamlessly with my new carrier. FEATURES: It has several options to create your personal menu(s) - effectively alleviating the need to scroll through multi-levels and sub-levels to access one feature. (e.g. MENU/MY STUFF/TOOLS/Calculator, or Currency converter, or World time, or Recent calls, etc. is now just OPTIONS/Calculator, or Currency converter, or World time, or Recent calls, etc. CAPS = 1 LEVEL each.) Not only can you set your own menu(s) but there are extra blanks to create/add functionality! I primarily wanted a solid reliable phone. Just a phone - period. No bells or whistles. The only ""CON"" for me is that the camera is only 1.3 megs. That is pretty bad but I carry a point and shoot when I need photos. So not a real deal breaker. I am just glad to get a phone that works - well. By the way, I ended up buying another one for future use in case I lost this one or damaged it in some way - basically I got a backup phone because I liked it so much. Cheers!",2
Samsung SGH a777 - Cellular phone - 3G - WCDMA (UMTS) / GSM - slider - Blue - AT&T,Samsung,99.99,5,"Please see my replies to comments from highflyer, R. L. Miller, and sunshine79.I received my first SGH-A777 phone in 2009-May, and it worked great for my use -- cell. phone with simple PDA functions, still/video camera, and audio recorder. I don't have a data plan, so I can't attest to its utility for texting, navigating the web, GPS tracking, etc.After the flex cable broke in 2011-Dec, I ordered a replacement via Amazon. I bought the unlocked phone from PLANETCELL.COM.BR for $46! [See my Seller Feedback for price comparisons.] The main PCB (with CPU and radio module) has the same revision code (""2008 08 27 Rev 0.5""), but the firmware was updated with a few more features. I temporarily swapped out the main PCB to recover my data that can't be stored on the mini-SD card. (Sshhh! Don't tell anyone I voided the warranty.) I'll buy the $4 flex cable to fix the old one, so I'll have a back-up.Anyway, I do wish the phone could save copies of the Notes, Tasks, Events, and Alarms onto the mini-SD card. Since they can only be stored in the phone's memory, the allocation is static and cannot be increased -- another shortcoming. I also wish the Currency Converter allowed the conversion table coefficients to be imported and exported (up-to-date data from [...]). It's good that it allows me to add currencies. [Other phone vendors tend to allow only one converter coefficient, which must be manually entered each time the function is started.] I wish the calculator allowed memory locations to store/recall computed values; it would be great to have more math, scientific, and programming functions. It's good that it allows me to enter and edit the expression, and it supports precedence rules and parentheses. The tip calculator should have the ability to compute each person's share of tax and tip based on their purchases, rather than split everything up evenly. [What if I eat filet mignon with a nice cab, and my friend gets crab bisque with a CdQ? OK, I'm daydreaming.] I also want a Cut&Paste feature, as that will work well for phone numbers and numeric data when dealing with messages, phone book, conversions, etc. OMG, there should be an app. for that!P.S.: Calendar Events and Tasks neither wake up the phone nor are tagged as Missed Events if, at the programmed Alarm date/time, the phone is off. This also applies to Alarms, unless Auto Power-up is On -- that's a great feature if you turn off the phone to avoid distractions, but it can be embarassing if you're at 35,000 ft. and the phone is packed in your bag in the overhead bin. In this configuration, the alarm wakes up the phone, regardless of Airplane Mode setting. I pop out the battery pack to avoid surprises because the 25-button disabling sequence is a bit long, and later must be reversed to restore the normal operating state. [SW version A777UCHI5, no shortcuts: Open, Menu.Settings(9).SoundProfile(1).Silent(vSave), Phone(4).AirplaneMode(6).On(^SelBack*2), MyStuff(7).Tools(^^^Sel).Alarms(3).AutoPower-up(6).Off(vSelBack*4), Off(Press&HoldRedKey), Close]",2

Thats if you are mostly on standby and do not play with any of the menu settings or actually get or make some calls. Then it needs recharging daily. The dialup buttons are definitely in the way as they want you online to spend your bucks. Camera is very poor. Bottom line, there's almost no competition nowadays in the sensible dumb phone market, so all in all its not bad. Beats packing something the size of a smart phone around as some of us more mature folks just want to make actual phone calls.

Samsung SGH-T259 3G Global GSM Cell Phone - T-Mobile,Samsung,249.99,5,"This is plenty of phone for those who want nice little extra features without going android. Fairly low EMF, functional camera that is not all that bad really for just taking fairly close up phone shots. Decent sound but does take a bit of getting used to as the sound quality itself projects differently than on some cellphones. Hard to explain but you almost want to figure out where the speaker is on it, precisely! Speaker phone is adequate if you are in a quiet setting. I don't use the other functions but they are all there including the web and blue tooth. Hubby uses the bluetooth on his for driving and says it works fine. Size is sturdy if you don't like the super slim phones that easily slip out of older fingers and will just fit tidily into a backpocket. Ringer is nice and loud at full volume and can be turned down to the point it only vibrates. The vibration will catch your attention in a pocket for sure but can also make it jump off a counter so keep it away from the edges of surfaces. Front display is good sized and clear and the well lit keypad is large enough even for middle agers to be pleased with. Nice size photo display inside also for placing your favorite snaps of loved ones. We have had ours several months without any notable issues using Tmobil. If they last as long as the previous Samsungs we will be more than happy with this purchase also. Plain phone for plain good use; nothing more and nothing less.",10

Completely inoperable. Not only this, but she packaged it poorly in just an envelope with no padding or protection.

Samsung SGH-T989 Galaxy S II 16GB White Android Phone - T-Mobile,Samsung,109.74,2,"""Condition: Used - Like NewComments: BRAND NEW - the only thing that is used is the battery, which is still in good condition.......""My decision to buy the above item was based on the above description from the seller. In my analysis, I should have asked myself in which phone the battery was used if the phone itself was not used, but trusted the seller for it. However, if the phone came with 115 contacts' numbers on it, besides text messages and various call logs, then I am at a loss as to what the seller's BRAND NEW description meant. Was it my mind that was playing games on me, or it was the seller?This is utter dishonesty, mischievous, totally unacceptable, against all business ethics, and need to be condemned in no uncertain terms.'DISHONESTY' ON THE PART OF ONE OR THE OTHER IS THE ATTITUDE THAT HAS BROUGHT THE WORLD TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY - TOTAL CHAOS, INSTABILITY, WAR, DISORDER, BEING AT EACH OTHERS THROAT. ETC. ETC.Personally I believe it is best to always tell the truth -TRUTH ALWAYS PREVAILS - and have one's peace, rather than telling lies and sitting on thorns. To this seller, my advice is not to go by this route again, for the next victim may not be as kind, sympathetic, and considerate as I am, and may want to demand his/her pound of flesh.Sorry if I appear to be too hard on you, madam.",2

Yes, apple has some great products-ones that i still will use daily.But this samsung Galaxy tops the iphone. I like the playstore more than the Itunes, or appstore. The phone screen seems bigger and it feels amazing in my hand, i fell in love instantly. This phone has many motion activated actions that improve its quality like turning it over to mute it. I highly recommend it. If you are an apple fan, you can still go check one out at a local store and you will see that it has great features and at a lower cost in most cases.",0
